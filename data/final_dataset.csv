Mice in Bion-M 1 space mission: training and selection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4136787/,"After a 16-year hiatus, Russia has resumed its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19–May 19, 2013). The principal species for biomedical research in this project was the mouse. This paper presents an overview of the scientific goals, the experimental design and the mouse training/selection program. The aim of mice experiments in the Bion-M 1 project was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined in vivo measurements, both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure measurement), with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return of the mice and in the end of recovery study. Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite, or remained on ground in the control experiment that replicated environmental and housing conditions in the spacecraft. Vivarium control groups were used to account for housing effects and possible seasonal differences. Mice training included the co-adaptation in housing groups and mice adaptation to paste food diet. The measures taken to co-adapt aggressive male mice in housing groups and the peculiarities of “space” paste food are described. The training program for mice designated for in vivo studies was broader and included behavioral/functional test battery and continuous behavioral measurements in the home-cage. The results of the preliminary tests were used for the selection of homogenous groups. After the flight, mice were in good condition for biomedical studies and displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity. The outcomes of the training program for the mice welfare are discussed. We conclude that our training program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed in space biomedical research.",year hiatus russia resumed program biomedical research space successful day flight bionm biosatellite april may principal species biomedical research project mouse paper presents overview scientific goals experimental design mouse trainingselection program aim mice experiments bionm project elucidate cellular molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation key physiological systems longterm exposure microgravity studies mice combined vivo measurements flight postflight including continuous blood pressure measurement extensive vitro studies carried shortly return mice end recovery study male cbl mice group housed space habitats flown aboard bionm biosatellite remained ground control experiment replicated environmental housing conditions spacecraft vivarium control groups used account housing effects possible seasonal differences mice training included coadaptation housing groups mice adaptation paste food diet measures taken coadapt aggressive male mice housing groups peculiarities space paste food described training program mice designated vivo studies broader included behavioralfunctional test battery continuous behavioral measurements homecage results preliminary tests used selection homogenous groups flight mice good condition biomedical studies displayed signs pronounced disadaptation earths gravity outcomes training program mice welfare discussed conclude training program effective male mice successfully employed space biomedical research
"Microgravity induces pelvic bone loss through osteoclastic activity, osteocytic osteolysis, and osteoblastic cell cycle inhibition by CDKN1a/p21",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630201/,"Bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of mineral content and structure. Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% (p = 0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-sectional area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter (+6%, p = 0.037). Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 in bone, as measured by RT-qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (+12.94, +2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively, p<0.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01), and was localized to osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells. Finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by −1.54 fold (p<0.01), possibly associated with the quiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to osteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest.",bone dynamically remodeled tissue requires gravitymediated mechanical stimulation maintenance mineral content structure homeostasis bone occurs balance activities signaling osteoclasts osteoblasts osteocytes well proliferation differentiation stem cell progenitors microgravity unloading known cause osteoclastmediated bone resorption however hypothesize osteocytic osteolysis cell cycle arrest osteogenesis may also contribute bone loss space test possibility exposed weekold female cblj mice microgravity days sts space shuttle mission analysis pelvis shows decreases bone volume fraction bvtv bone thickness trappositive osteoclastcovered trabecular bone surfaces also increased microgravity indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration highresolution xray nanoct studies revealed signs lacunar osteolysis including increases crosssectional area perimeter canalicular diameter expression matrix metalloproteinases mmp bone measured rtqpcr also upregulated microgravity fold respectively mmp localized osteocytes consistent induction osteocytic osteolysis furthermore expression cdknap bone increased fold localized osteoblasts possibly inhibiting cell cycle tissue regeneration well conferring apoptosis resistance cells finally apoptosis inducer trp downregulated fold possibly associated quiescent survivalpromoting function cdknap conclusion findings identify pelvic femoral region mouse skeleton active site rapid bone loss microgravity indicate loss limited osteoclastic degradation therefore study offers new evidence microgravityinduced osteocytic osteolysis cdknapmediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest
Stem Cell Health and Tissue Regeneration in Microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11988870/,"Microgravity, defined by minimal gravitational forces, represents a unique environment that profoundly influences biological systems, including human cells. This review examines the effects of microgravity on biological processes and their implications for human health. Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting key mechanisms, such as T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural maturation, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity. These advancements enable the development of functional cardiomyocytes, presenting promising therapeutic opportunities for treating cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarctions. These findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health. They highlight its potential to drive advances in regenerative therapies, oncology, and immunological interventions. Continued research into the biological effects of microgravity is essential for protecting astronaut health during prolonged space missions and fostering biomedical innovations with transformative applications on Earth.

Microgravity Reduces the Differentiation and Regenerative Potential of Embryonic Stem Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7998608/,"Therapeutic effects of adult stem-cell transplantations are limited by poor cell-retention in target organs, and a reduced potential for optimal cell differentiation compared to embryonic stem cells. However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell proliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres in a stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100−300 μm) and cultured using a wave-stirring shaker. One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased the proportions of SSEA-3(+) hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in their numbers), respectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for proliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We believe that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative therapies using hASCs.

Microgravity validation of a novel system for RNA isolation and multiplex quantitative real time PCR analysis of gene expression on the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5587110/,"The International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory is dedicated to studying the effects of space on life and physical systems, and to developing new science and technologies for space exploration. A key aspect of achieving these goals is to operate the ISS National Lab more like an Earth-based laboratory, conducting complex end-to-end experimentation, not limited to simple microgravity exposure. Towards that end NASA developed a novel suite of molecular biology laboratory tools, reagents, and methods, named WetLab-2, uniquely designed to operate in microgravity, and to process biological samples for real-time gene expression analysis on-orbit. This includes a novel fluidic RNA Sample Preparation Module and fluid transfer devices, all-in-one lyophilized PCR assays, centrifuge, and a real-time PCR thermal cycler. Here we describe the results from the WetLab-2 validation experiments conducted in microgravity during ISS increment 47/SPX-8. Specifically, quantitative PCR was performed on a concentration series of DNA calibration standards, and Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR was conducted on RNA extracted and purified on-orbit from frozen Escherichia coli and mouse liver tissue. Cycle threshold (Ct) values and PCR efficiencies obtained on-orbit from DNA standards were similar to Earth (1 g) controls. Also, on-orbit multiplex analysis of gene expression from bacterial cells and mammalian tissue RNA samples was successfully conducted in about 3 h, with data transmitted within 2 h of experiment completion. Thermal cycling in microgravity resulted in the trapping of gas bubbles inside septa cap assay tubes, causing small but measurable increases in Ct curve noise and variability. Bubble formation was successfully suppressed in a rapid follow-up on-orbit experiment using standard caps to pressurize PCR tubes and reduce gas release during heating cycles. The WetLab-2 facility now provides a novel operational on-orbit research capability for molecular biology and demonstrates the feasibility of more complex wet bench experiments in the ISS National Lab environment.",international space station iss national laboratory dedicated studying effects space life physical systems developing new science technologies space exploration key aspect achieving goals operate iss national lab like earthbased laboratory conducting complex endtoend experimentation limited simple microgravity exposure towards end nasa developed novel suite molecular biology laboratory tools reagents methods named wetlab uniquely designed operate microgravity process biological samples realtime gene expression analysis onorbit includes novel fluidic rna sample preparation module fluid transfer devices allinone lyophilized pcr assays centrifuge realtime pcr thermal cycler describe results wetlab validation experiments conducted microgravity iss increment spx specifically quantitative pcr performed concentration series dna calibration standards reverse transcriptasequantitative pcr conducted rna extracted purified onorbit frozen escherichia coli mouse liver tissue cycle threshold values pcr efficiencies obtained onorbit dna standards similar earth controls also onorbit multiplex analysis gene expression bacterial cells mammalian tissue rna samples successfully conducted data transmitted within experiment completion thermal cycling microgravity resulted trapping gas bubbles inside septa cap assay tubes causing small measurable increases curve noise variability bubble formation successfully suppressed rapid followup onorbit experiment using standard caps pressurize pcr tubes reduce gas release heating cycles wetlab facility provides novel operational onorbit research capability molecular biology demonstrates feasibility complex wet bench experiments iss national lab environment
Spaceflight Modulates the Expression of Key Oxidative Stress and Cell Cycle Related Genes in Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8396460/,"Spaceflight causes cardiovascular changes due to microgravity-induced redistribution of body fluids and musculoskeletal unloading. Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with altered Trp53 and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceflight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceflight. Mice were exposed to spaceflight for 15 days or maintained on Earth (ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting ~3 h post-landing. We measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and Trp53 signaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after spaceflight. Spaceflight downregulated transcription factor, Nfe2l2 (Nrf2) , upregulated Nox1 and downregulated Ptgs2 , suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes. Spaceflight also substantially upregulated Cdkn1a ( p21 ) and cell cycle/apoptosis-related gene Myc , and downregulated the inflammatory response gene Tnf . There were no changes in apoptosis-related genes such as Trp53 . Spaceflight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle and senescence in cardiac tissue of mice. Thus, spaceflight may contribute to cardiac dysfunction due to oxidative stress.

Dose- and Ion-Dependent Effects in the Oxidative Stress Response to Space-Like Radiation Exposure in the Skeletal System,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666799/,"Space radiation may pose a risk to skeletal health during subsequent aging. Irradiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term influence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/n) or high-LET 56 Fe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA’s Space Radiation Lab. Five weeks or one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry. Marrow-derived, adherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by RT-PCR during the proliferative or mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by imaging mineralized nodules. As expected, a high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of either 56 Fe or protons caused a loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. Marrow cells produced mineralized nodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type or dose; 56 Fe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by more than 90% (5 weeks and 1 year post-IR). After 5 weeks, irradiation (protons or 56 Fe) caused few changes in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although a high dose 56 Fe (200 cGy) increased Catalase and Gadd45 . The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET ( 137 Cs γ) when irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET 56 Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either protons or 56 Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET 56 Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss.

High-precision method for cyclic loading of small-animal vertebrae to assess bone quality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6222041/,"One potentially important bone quality characteristic is the response of bone to cyclic (repetitive) mechanical loading. In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and difficult-to-eliminate machine compliance. Addressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analysis to measure stiffness to prescribe force levels that produce the same specified level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate utility, we measured fatigue life for three groups ( n = 5–6 per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new method against two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the mechanical behavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In particular, for a controlled level of strain, the standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower for the new method (F-ratio = 4.9; p < 0.01). The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae may help elucidate aspects of bone quality.

Effects of ex vivo ionizing radiation on collagen structure and whole-bone mechanical properties of mouse vertebrae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6813909/,"Bone can become brittle when exposed to ionizing radiation across a wide range of clinically relevant doses that span from radiotherapy (accumulative 50 Gy) to sterilization (~35,000 Gy). While irradiation-induced embrittlement has been attributed to changes in the collagen molecular structure, the relative role of collagen fragmentation versus non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking remains unclear. To better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material without cellular activity, we conducted an ex vivo x-ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae. Spinal tissue from twenty-week old, female, C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a single x-ray radiation dose of either 0 (control), 50, 1,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy. Measurements were made for collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and both monotonic and cyclic-loading compressive mechanical properties. We found that the group differences for mechanical properties were more consistent with those for collagen fragmentation than for non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking. Monotonic strength at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy was lower than that of the control by 50% and 73% respectively, ( p < 0.001) but at 50 and 1,000 Gy was not different than the control. Consistent with those trends, collagen fragmentation only occurred at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy. By contrast, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking was greater than control for all radiation doses ( p < 0.001). All results were consistent both for monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. We conclude that the reductions in bone compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life due to ex vivo ionizing radiation are more likely caused by fragmentation of the collagen backbone than any increases in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.

Absence of gamma-sarcoglycan alters the response of p70S6 kinase to mechanical perturbation in murine skeletal muscle,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4095884/,"Background The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) is located at the sarcolemma of muscle fibers, providing structural integrity. Mutations in and loss of DGC proteins cause a spectrum of muscular dystrophies. When only the sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe myofiber degeneration, but little susceptibility to contractile damage, suggesting that disease occurs not by structural deficits but through aberrant signaling, namely, loss of normal mechanotransduction signaling through the sarcoglycan complex. We extended our previous studies on mechanosensitive, γ-sarcoglycan-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, to determine whether additional pathways are altered with the loss of γ-sarcoglycan. Methods We examined mechanotransduction in the presence and absence of γ-sarcoglycan, using C2C12 myotubes, and primary cultures and isolated muscles from C57Bl/6 (C57) and γ-sarcoglycan-null (γ-SG -/- ) mice. All were subjected to cyclic passive stretch. Signaling protein phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting of lysates from stretched and non-stretched samples. Calcium dependence was assessed by maintaining muscles in calcium-free or tetracaine-supplemented Ringer’s solution. Dependence on mTOR was determined by stretching isolated muscles in the presence or absence of rapamycin. Results C2C12 myotube stretch caused a robust increase in P-p70S6K, but decreased P-FAK and P-ERK2. Neither Akt nor ERK1 were responsive to passive stretch. Similar but non-significant trends were observed in C57 primary cultures in response to stretch, and γ-SG -/- cultures displayed no p70S6K response. In contrast, in isolated muscles, p70S6K was mechanically responsive. Basal p70S6K activation was elevated in muscles of γ-SG -/- mice, in a calcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both C57 and γ-SG -/- isolated muscles, and was sustained in γ-SG -/- muscles, unlike the transient response in C57 muscles. Rapamycin treatment blocked all of p70S6K activation in stretched C57 muscles, and reduced downstream S6RP phosphorylation. However, even though rapamycin treatment decreased p70S6K activation in stretched γ-SG -/- muscles, S6RP phosphorylation remained elevated. Conclusions p70S6K is an important component of γ-sarcoglycan-dependent mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that loss of γ-sarcoglycan uncouples the response of p70S6K to stretch and implies that γ-sarcoglycan is important for inactivation of this pathway. Overall, we assert that altered load-sensing mechanisms exist in muscular dystrophies where the sarcoglycans are absent.

Many Rab-like proteins exist in plants, but only a subset have been functionally characterized. Results Here we report that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c play important roles in pollen development, germination and tube elongation. AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have no obvious morphological changes compared with wild-type plants across a variety of growth conditions. An AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is also indistinguishable from wild-type plants during vegetative growth; however its siliques are shorter than those in wild-type plants. Compared with wild-type plants, AtrabD2b/2c mutants produce deformed pollen with swollen and branched pollen tube tips. The shorter siliques in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were found to be primarily due to the pollen defects. AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have different but overlapping expression patterns, and they are both highly expressed in pollen. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c protein localize to Golgi bodies.

TNO1 is involved in salt tolerance and vacuolar trafficking in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3177255/,"The Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor SYP41 is involved in vesicle fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and interacts with AtVPS45, SYP61, and VTI12. These proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes, including vacuole biogenesis and stress tolerance. A previously uncharacterized protein, named TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), was identified by coimmunoprecipitation as a SYP41-interacting protein. TNO1 was found to localize to the TGN by immunofluorescence microscopy. A tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. Localization of SYP61, which is involved in the salt stress response, was disrupted in the tno1 mutant. Vacuolar proteins were partially secreted to the apoplast in the tno1 mutant, suggesting that TNO1 is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. The tno1 mutant had delayed formation of the brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon application of BFA, suggesting less efficient membrane fusion processes in the mutant. Unlike most TGN proteins, TNO1 does not relocate to the BFA compartment upon BFA treatment.

Functional redundancy between trans-Golgi network SNARE family members in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11500582/,"SNAREs play an important role in the process of membrane trafficking. In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana protein reported to interact with a trans -Golgi network-localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP ( Arabidopsis thaliana G lycosyl T ransferase- L ike P rotein) and predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminal part of its amino acid sequence. Colocalization data we collected suggest that AtGTLP should localize mainly to Golgi apparatus, especially to certain zones of trans -Golgi. As single atgtlp−/− mutants showed no obvious difference in phenotype (primary root length and fresh mass), AtGTLP and proteins related to AtGTLP with high similarity in amino acid sequences may have redundant functions.

Root growth movements: Waving and skewing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5387210/,"Background The movement of plant roots within the soil is key to their ability to interact with the environment and maximize anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. Roots growing on slanted, impenetrable growth medium display a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these phenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies a role for a trans -Golgi network-localized protein in root skewing. Results We found that Arabidopsis thaliana TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), a putative tethering factor localized at the trans -Golgi network, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display enhanced root skewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1 roots increases upon microtubule stabilization, but is insensitive to microtubule destabilization. Microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell morphology in tno1 seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell file rotation is independent of the orientation of microtubule arrays. Conclusions We conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing in a mechanism that is dependent on microtubules but is not linked to disruption of the orientation of microtubule arrays. In addition, TNO1 is required for maintenance of cell morphology in mature regions of roots and the base of hypocotyls. The TGN-localized SNARE machinery might therefore be important for appropriate epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root growth.

Gravitropism and lateral root emergence are dependent on the trans-Golgi network protein TNO1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4642138/,"The trans -Golgi network (TGN) is a dynamic organelle that functions as a relay station for receiving endocytosed cargo, directing secretory cargo, and trafficking to the vacuole. TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is a large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil protein that associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41, a target SNARE, and is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. Here, we show that a tno1 mutant has auxin transport-related defects. Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence, decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to the auxin analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the natural auxin 3-indoleacetic acid. Auxin asymmetry at the tips of elongating stage II lateral roots was reduced in the tno1 mutant, suggesting a role for TNO1 in cellular auxin transport during lateral root emergence. During gravistimulation, tno1 roots exhibited delayed auxin transport from the columella to the basal epidermal cells. Endocytosis to the TGN was unaffected in the mutant, indicating that bulk endocytic defects are not responsible for the observed phenotypes. Together these studies demonstrate a role for TNO1 in mediating auxin responses during root development and gravistimulation, potentially through trafficking of auxin transport proteins.

The Drosophila SUN protein Spag4 cooperates with the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin to maintain association of the basal body and spermatid nucleus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915878/,"Maintaining the proximity of centrosomes to nuclei is important in several cellular contexts, and LINC complexes formed by SUN and KASH proteins are crucial in this process. Here, we characterize the presumed Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian SUN protein, sperm-associated antigen 4 (Spag4, previously named Giacomo), and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear attachment during spermatogenesis. Production of spag4 mRNA is limited to the testis, and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the germline nuclei, including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment of the single spermatid centriole. In the absence of Spag4, nuclei and centrioles or basal bodies (BBs) dissociate from each other after meiosis. This role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH proteins of the Drosophila genome (Klarsicht and MSP-300), but does require the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Yuri shows an identical pattern of localization at the nuclear surface to Spag4 during spermatogenesis, and epistasis studies show that the activities of Yuri and dynein-dynactin are downstream of spag4 in this centriole attachment pathway. The later defects in spermatogenesis seen for yuri and spag4 mutants are similar, suggesting they could be secondary to initial disruption of events at the nuclear surface.

Toll mediated infection response is altered by gravity and spaceflight in Drosophila,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3901686/,"Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires better understanding of the biological consequences of long-term exposure to spaceflight. Immune function in particular is relevant for space travel. Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions. In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat shock chaperone system. Our major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects, and that spaceflight produces stress-related transcriptional responses and results in a specific inability to mount a Toll-mediated infection response.",space travel presents unlimited opportunities exploration discovery requires better understanding biological consequences longterm exposure spaceflight immune function particular relevant space travel human immune responses weakened space increased vulnerability opportunistic infections immunerelated conditions addition microorganisms become virulent space causing challenges health understand issues better contribute design effective countermeasures used drosophila model innate immunity study immune responses hypergravity spaceflight focusing infections mediated conserved toll imd signaling pathways found hypergravity improves resistance tollmediated fungal infections except known gravitaxis mutant yuri gagarin gene results led first spaceflight project drosophila immunity flies developed adulthood microgravity assessed immune responses transcription profiling return earth spaceflight alone altered transcription producing activation heat shock stress system space flies subsequently infected fungus failed activate toll pathway contrast bacterial infection produced normal activation imd pathway speculate possible linkage functional toll signaling heat shock chaperone system major findings hypergravity spaceflight opposing effects spaceflight produces stressrelated transcriptional responses results specific inability mount tollmediated infection response
GeneLab database analyses suggest long-term impact of space radiation on the cardiovascular system by the activation of FYN through reactive oxygen species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6387434/,"Space radiation has recently been considered a risk factor for astronauts’ cardiac health. As an example, for the case of how to query and identify datasets within NASA’s GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. This knowledge can contribute to designing appropriate experiments targeting these specific pathways. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n 56 Fe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS). We observed common molecular pathways between simulated space radiation and HUVECs flown on the ISS. The analysis suggests FYN is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulate FYN , which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the spaceflight signature than 56 Fe’s signature. To our knowledge, this is the first time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis. More generally, this work also demonstrates how to combine animal radiation studies done on the ground and spaceflight studies to evaluate human risk in space.

Machine learning algorithm to characterize antimicrobial resistance associated with the International Space Station surface microbiome,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9400218/,"Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has a detrimental impact on human health on Earth and it is equally concerning in other environments such as space habitat due to microgravity, radiation and confinement, especially for long-distance space travel. The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking–1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes). Results We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii , a bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT-1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many isolates, including two top-ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus . Computational predictions were experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these two species, showing a high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed the high resistance of these two pathogens to various beta-lactam antibiotics. Conclusion Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.

Aging and putative frailty biomarkers are altered by spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166946/,"Human space exploration poses inherent risks to astronauts’ health, leading to molecular changes that can significantly impact their well-being. These alterations encompass genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased inflammation, homeostatic dysregulation, and various epigenomic changes. Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA’s GeneLab, along with astronaut data gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Our objective was to assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions.

Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7000411/,"While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll , suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.

Prolonged Exposure to Microgravity Reduces Cardiac Contractility and Initiates Remodeling in Drosophila,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787258/,"SUMMARY Understanding the effects of microgravity on human organs is crucial to exploration of low-earth orbit, the moon, and beyond. Drosophila can be sent to space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans. Flies reared in microgravity exhibit cardiac constriction with myofibrillar remodeling and diminished output. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in isolated hearts revealed reduced expression of sarcomeric/extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and dramatically increased proteasomal gene expression, consistent with the observed compromised, smaller hearts and suggesting abnormal proteostasis. This was examined further on a second flight in which we found dramatically elevated proteasome aggregates co-localizing with increased amyloid and polyQ deposits. Remarkably, in long-QT causing sei/hERG mutants, proteasomal gene expression at 1 g , although less than the wild-type expression, was nevertheless increased in microgravity. Therefore, cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress may be a fundamental response of heart muscle to microgravity.",summary understanding effects microgravity human organs crucial exploration lowearth orbit moon beyond drosophila sent space large numbers examine effects microgravity heart structure function fundamentally conserved flies humans flies reared microgravity exhibit cardiac constriction myofibrillar remodeling diminished output rna sequencing rnaseq isolated hearts revealed reduced expression sarcomericextracellular matrix ecm genes dramatically increased proteasomal gene expression consistent observed compromised smaller hearts suggesting abnormal proteostasis examined second flight found dramatically elevated proteasome aggregates colocalizing increased amyloid polyq deposits remarkably longqt causing seiherg mutants proteasomal gene expression although less wildtype expression nevertheless increased microgravity therefore cardiac remodeling proteostatic stress may fundamental response heart muscle microgravity
Regulation of plant gravity sensing and signaling by the actin cytoskeleton.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8716943/,"Primary root growth is required by the plant to anchor in the soil and reach out for nutrients and water, while dealing with obstacles. Efficient root elongation and bending depends upon the coordinated action of environmental sensing, signal transduction, and growth responses. The actin cytoskeleton is a highly plastic network that constitutes a point of integration for environmental stimuli and hormonal pathways. In this review, we present a detailed compilation highlighting the importance of the actin cytoskeleton during primary root growth and we describe how actin-binding proteins, plant hormones, and actin-disrupting drugs affect root growth and root actin. We also discuss the feedback loop between actin and root responses to light and gravity. Actin affects cell division and elongation through the control of its own organization. We remark upon the importance of longitudinally oriented actin bundles as a hallmark of cell elongation as well as the role of the actin cytoskeleton in protein trafficking and vacuolar reshaping during this process. The actin network is shaped by a plethora of actin-binding proteins; however, there is still a large gap in connecting the molecular function of these proteins with their developmental effects. Here, we summarize their function and known effects on primary root growth with a focus on their high level of specialization. Light and gravity are key factors that help us understand root growth directionality. The response of the root to gravity relies on hormonal, particularly auxin, homeostasis, and the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is necessary for the perception of the gravity stimulus via the repositioning of sedimenting statoliths, but it is also involved in mediating the growth response via the trafficking of auxin transporters and cell elongation. Furthermore, auxin and auxin analogs can affect the composition of the actin network, indicating a potential feedback loop. Light, in its turn, affects actin organization and hence, root growth, although its precise role remains largely unknown. Recently, fundamental studies with the latest techniques have given us more in-depth knowledge of the role and organization of actin in the coordination of root growth; however, there remains a lot to discover, especially in how actin organization helps cell shaping, and therefore root growth.

Brassinosteroids inhibit autotropic root straightening by modifying filamentous-actin organization and dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010715/,"When positioned horizontally, roots grow down toward the direction of gravity. This phenomenon, called gravitropism, is influenced by most of the major plant hormones including brassinosteroids. Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown to enhance root gravitropism, a phenomenon similar to the response of roots exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin B (LatB). This led us to hypothesize that eBL might enhance root gravitropism through its effects on filamentous-actin (F-actin). This hypothesis was tested by comparing gravitropic responses of maize ( Zea mays ) roots treated with eBL or LatB. LatB- and eBL-treated roots displayed similar enhanced downward growth compared with controls when vertical roots were oriented horizontally. Moreover, the effects of the two compounds on root growth directionality were more striking on a slowly-rotating two-dimensional clinostat. Both compounds inhibited autotropism, a process in which the root straightened after the initial gravistimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation. Although eBL reduced F-actin density in chemically-fixed Z. mays roots, the impact was not as strong as that of LatB. Modification of F-actin organization after treatment with both compounds was also observed in living roots of barrel medic ( Medicago truncatula ) seedlings expressing genetically encoded F-actin reporters. Like in fixed Z. mays roots, eBL effects on F-actin in living M. truncatula roots were modest compared with those of LatB. Furthermore, live cell imaging revealed a decrease in global F-actin dynamics in hypocotyls of etiolated M. truncatula seedlings treated with eBL compared to controls. Collectively, our data indicate that eBL-and LatB-induced enhancement of root gravitropism can be explained by inhibited autotropic root straightening, and that eBL affects this process, in part, by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics.

Cell type-specific imaging of calcium signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana seedling roots using GCaMP3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7503278/,"Cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ) is a well-characterized second messenger in eukaryotic cells. An elevation in [Ca 2+ ] cyt levels is one of the earliest responses in plant cells after exposure to a range of environmental stimuli. Advances in understanding the role of [Ca 2+ ] cyt in plant development has been facilitated by the use of genetically-encoded reporters such as GCaMP. Most of these studies have relied on promoters such as Cauliflower Mosaic Virus ( 35S ) and Ubiquitin10 ( UBQ10 ) to drive expression of GCaMP in all cell/tissue types. Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types that likely exhibit unique [Ca 2+ ] cyt responses to exogenous and endogenous signals. However, few studies have addressed this question. Here, we introduce a set of Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing GCaMP3 in five root cell types including the columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. We found similarities and differences in the [Ca 2+ ] cyt signature among these root cell types when exposed to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and salt, which are known to trigger [Ca 2+ ] cyt increases in root cells.

The bone density reduction under microgravity was mostly recovered by 1 g but only partially recovered by 1/6 g .

Manipulating the permeation of charged compounds through the MscL nanovalve.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005423/,"MscL is a bacterial mechanosensor that serves as a biological emergency release valve, releasing cytoplasmic solutes to the environment on osmotic downshock. Previous studies have recognized that this channel has properties that make it ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve for vesicular-based targeted drug-release devices. One can even change the modality of the sensor. Briefly, the introduction of charges into the MscL pore lumen gates the channel in the absence of membrane tension; thus, by inserting compounds that acquire a charge on exposure to an alternative stimulus, such as light or pH, into the pore of the channel, controllable nanoswitches that detect these alternative modalities have been engineered. However, a charge in the pore lumen could not only encourage actuation of the nanopore but also have a significant influence on the permeation of large charged compounds, which would thus have important implications for the efficiency of drug-release devices. In this study, we used in vivo and electrophysiological approaches to demonstrate that the introduction of a charge into pore lumen of MscL does indeed influence the permeation of charged molecules. These effects were more drastic for larger compounds and, surprisingly, were related to the orientation of the MscL channel in the membrane.—Yang, L-M, Blount, P.

The oligomeric state of the truncated mechanosensitive channel of large conductance shows no variance in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3190158/,"The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from E. coli serves as an emergency release valve allowing the cell to survive acute osmotic downshock. It is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension. Two MscL crystal structures of the orthologs M. tuberculosis and S. aureus have been solved showing pentameric and tetrameric structures, respectively. Several studies followed to understand whether the discrepancy in their stoichiometry was a species difference or a consequence of the protein manipulation for crystallization. Two independent studies now agree that the full-length S. aureus MscL is actually a pentamer, not tetramer. While detergents appear to play a role in modifying the oligomeric state of the protein, a cytoplasmic helical bundle has also been implicated. Here, we evaluate the role of the C-terminal region of S. aureus MscL in the oligomerization of the channel in native membranes by using an in vivo disulfide-trapping technique. We find that the oligomeric state of S. aureus MscLs with different C-terminal truncations, including the one used to obtain the tetrameric S. aureus MscL crystal structure, are pentamers in vivo . Thus, the C-terminal domain of the S. aureus protein only plays a critical role in the oligomeric state of the SaMscL protein when it is solubilized in detergent.

Three routes to modulate the pore size of the MscL channel/nanovalve,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3289768/,"MscL is a bacterial mechanosensitive channel that protects cells from lysis upon acute decrease in external osmotic environment. It is one of the best characterized mechanosensors known, thus serving as a paradigm of how such molecules sense and respond to stimuli. In addition, the fact that it can be genetically modified, expressed, isolated, and manipulated has led to its proposed use as a triggered nanovalve for various functions including sensors within microelectronic array chips, as well as vesicular-based targeted drug release. X-ray crystallography reveals a homo-pentameric complex with each subunit containing two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) and a single carboxyl terminal α-helix arranging within the complex to form a five-fold cytoplasmic bundle (CB), whose function and stability remain unclear. In this study, we show three routes that throttle the open channel conductance. When the linker between the TM2 and CB domain is shortened by deletions or constrained by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination, the conductance of the channel is reduced; in later two cases, even reversibly. While having implications for the stability of the CB, these data also provide routes for engineering MscL sensors that are more versatile for potential nanotech devices.

The dynamics of protein-protein interactions between domains of MscL at the cytoplasmic-lipid interface,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3508904/,"The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is one of the best characterized mechanosensitive channels serving as a paradigm for how proteins can sense and transduce mechanical forces. The physiological role of MscL is that of an emergency release valve that opens a large pore upon a sudden drop in the osmolarity of the environment. A crystal structure of a closed state of MscL shows it as a homopentamer, with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains (TM). There is consensus that the TM helices move in an iris like manner tilting in the plane of the membrane while gating. An N-terminal amphipathic helix that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane (S1), and the portion of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface (TM2 ci ), are relatively close in the crystal structure, yet predicted to be dynamic upon gating. Here we determine how these two regions interact in the channel complex, and study how these interactions change as the channel opens. We have screened 143 double-cysteine mutants of E. coli MscL for their efficiency in disulfide bridging and generated a map of protein-protein interactions between these two regions. Interesting candidates have been further studied by patch clamp and show differences in channel activity under different redox potentials; the results suggest a model for the dynamics of these two domains during MscL gating.

The MscS and MscL families of mechanosensitive channels act as microbial emergency release valves,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3430326/,"Single-celled organisms must survive exposure to environmental extremes. Perhaps one of the most variable and potentially life-threatening changes that can occur is that of a rapid and acute decrease in external osmolarity. This easily translates into several atmospheres of additional pressure that can build up within the cell. Without a protective mechanism against such pressures, the cell will lyse. Hence, most microbes appear to possess members of one or both families of bacterial mechanosensitive channels, MscS and MscL, which can act as biological emergency release valves that allow cytoplasmic solutes to be jettisoned rapidly from the cell. While this is undoubtedly a function of these proteins, the discovery of the presence of MscS homologues in plant organelles and MscL in fungus and mycoplasma genomes may complicate this simplistic interpretation of the physiology underlying these proteins. Here we compare and contrast these two mechanosensitive channel families, discuss their potential physiological roles, and review some of the most relevant data that underlie the current models for their structure and function.",singlecelled organisms must survive exposure environmental extremes perhaps one variable potentially lifethreatening changes occur rapid acute decrease external osmolarity easily translates several atmospheres additional pressure build within cell without protective mechanism pressures cell lyse hence microbes appear possess members one families bacterial mechanosensitive channels mscs mscl act biological emergency release valves allow cytoplasmic solutes jettisoned rapidly cell undoubtedly function proteins discovery presence mscs homologues plant organelles mscl fungus mycoplasma genomes may complicate simplistic interpretation physiology underlying proteins compare contrast two mechanosensitive channel families discuss potential physiological roles review relevant data underlie current models structure function

We observed that the production of ROS significantly increases as a function of time spent in anhydrobiosis and represents a direct demonstration of oxidative stress in tardigrades. The degree of involvement of bioprotectants, including those combating ROS, in the P. spatialis was evaluated by perturbing their gene functions using RNA interference and assessing the successful recovery of animals after desiccation/rehydration. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised survival during drying and rehydration, providing evidence for the role of the gene in desiccation tolerance. Targeting genes encoding glutathione reductase and catalase indicated that these molecules play roles during rehydration. Our study also confirms the involvement of aquaporins 3 and 10 during rehydration. Therefore, desiccation tolerance depends on the synergistic action of many different molecules working together.

Partial weight suspension: A novel murine model for investigating adaptation to reduced musculoskeletal loading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774184/,"We developed a new model of hypodynamic loading to support mice in chronic conditions of partial weight bearing, enabling simulations of reduced gravity environments and related clinical conditions. The novel hardware allows for reduced loading between 10 and 80% of normal body weight on all four limbs and enables characteristic quadrupedal locomotion. Ten-week-old female BALB/cByJ mice were supported for 21 days under Mars-analog suspension (38% weight bearing) and compared with age-matched and jacketed (100% weight bearing) controls. After an initial adaptation, weight gain did not differ between groups, suggesting low levels of animal stress. Relative to age-matched controls, mice exposed to Mars-analog loading had significantly lower muscle mass (−23% gastrocnemius wet mass, P < 0.0001); trabecular and cortical bone morphology (i.e., trabecular bone volume: −24% at the distal femur, and cortical thickness: −11% at the femoral midshaft, both P < 0.001); and biomechanical properties of the femoral midshaft (i.e., −27% ultimate moment, P < 0.001). Bone formation indexes were decreased compared with age-matched full-weight-bearing mice, whereas resorption parameters were largely unchanged. Singly housed, full-weight-bearing controls with forelimb jackets were largely similar to age-matched, group-housed controls, although a few variables differed and warrant further investigation. Altogether, these data provide strong rationale for use of our new model of partial weight bearing to further explore the musculoskeletal response to reduced loading environments.

"Partial reductions in mechanical loading yield proportional changes in bone density, bone architecture, and muscle mass",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4118556/,"Although the musculoskeletal system is known to be sensitive to changes in its mechanical environment, the relationship between functional adaptation and below-normal mechanical stimuli is not well defined. We investigated bone and muscle adaptation to a range of reduced loading using the partial weight suspension (PWS) system, in which a two-point harness is used to offload a tunable amount of body weight while maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. Skeletally mature female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to partial weight bearing at 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 21 days. A hindlimb unloaded (HLU) group was included for comparison in addition to age-matched controls in normal housing. Gait kinematics was measured across the full range of weight bearing, and some minor alterations in gait from PWS were identified. With PWS, bone and muscle changes were generally proportional to the degree of unloading. Specifically, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, trabecular bone volume of the distal femur, and cortical area of the femur midshaft were all linearly related to the degree of unloading. Even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing was associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. Weight bearing at 20% did not lead to better bone outcomes than HLU despite less muscle atrophy and presumably greater mechanical stimulus, requiring further investigation. These data confirm that the PWS model is highly effective in applying controllable, reduced, long-term loading that produces predictable, discrete adaptive changes in muscle and bone of the hindlimb.

Spaceflight and hind limb unloading induce similar changes in electrical impedance characteristics of mouse gastrocnemius muscle,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4653813/,"Objective To assess the potential of electrical impedance myography (EIM) to serve as a marker of muscle fiber atrophy and secondarily as an indicator of bone deterioration by assessing the effects of spaceflight or hind limb unloading. Methods In the first experiment, 6 mice were flown aboard the space shuttle (STS-135) for 13 days and 8 earthbound mice served as controls. In the second experiment, 14 mice underwent hind limb unloading (HLU) for 13 days; 13 additional mice served as controls. EIM measurements were made on ex vivo gastrocnemius muscle. Quantitative microscopy and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measurements of the hindlimb were also performed. Results Reductions in the multifrequency phase-slope parameter were observed for both the space flight and HLU cohorts compared to their respective controls. For ground control and spaceflight groups, the values were 24.7±1.3°/MHz and 14.1±1.6°/MHz, respectively (p=0.0013); for control and HLU groups, the values were 23.9±1.6°/MHz and 19.0±1.0°/MHz, respectively (p=0.014). This parameter also correlated with muscle fiber size (ρ=0.65, p=0.011) for spaceflight and hind limb aBMD (ρ=0.65, p=0.0063) for both groups.

Spaceflight Activates Lipotoxic Pathways in Mouse Liver,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6915713/,"Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) & BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of strain or exposure duration. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across all conditions including Glucagon (GCG) and Insulin (INS). Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis showed that a number of lipid related proteins were changed in the livers during spaceflight. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of lipotoxic pathways are the result of space stressors alone and this activation occurs in various genetic backgrounds during spaceflight exposures of weeks to months. If similar responses occur in humans, a prolonged change of these pathways may result in the development of liver disease and should be investigated further.

Treatment with a soluble bone morphogenetic protein type 1A receptor (BMPR1A) fusion protein increases bone mass and bone formation in mice subjected to hindlimb unloading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124165/,"Previous work has shown that the soluble murine BMPR1A–fusion protein (mBMPR1A‐mFc) binds to BMP2 and BMP4 with high affinity, preventing downstream signaling. Further, treatment of intact and ovariectomized mice with mBMPR1A‐mFc leads to increased bone mass, and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced resorption. In this study, we tested the effects of mBMPR1A‐mFc on disuse‐induced bone loss caused by 21 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension versus cage controls (CONs). Adult female C57BL/6J mice (12 weeks old) were assigned to one of four groups ( n = 10 each): CON‐VEH; CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc; HLU‐VEH; and HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc. Mice were injected subcutaneously with VEH or mBMPR1A‐mFc (4.5 mg/kg, 2×/week). Leg BMD declined in the HLU‐VEH group (–5.3% ± 1.3%), whereas it was unchanged in HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc (–0.3% ± 0.9%, p < 0.05 versus HLU‐VEH). Leg BMD increased significantly more in CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc than CON‐VEH (10.2% ± 0.6% versus 4.4% ± 0.8%). In the femur, trabecular, and cortical bone microarchitecture was worse in the HLU‐VEH compared to CON‐VEH mice, whereas mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment for 3 weeks led to greater Tb.BV/TV, Tb.Th, and midshaft Ct.Th in both the HLU and CON groups compared to comparable VEH‐treated counterparts ( p < 0.05). HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc mice also had 21% greater failure load ( p < 0.05) compared to their VEH‐treated counterparts. Dynamic histomorphometry indicated that treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFc led to significantly greater mineralizing surface and mineral apposition rate, resulting in a 3.5‐fold and fivefold higher bone formation rate in the mBMPR1A‐mFc‐treated CON and HLU animals versus VEH groups, respectively. mBMPR1A‐mFc‐treated mice had a similar osteoblast surface but significantly lower osteoclast surface than VEH‐treated animals in both the CON and HLU groups. Altogether, these findings suggest that treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein may be useful for maintenance of skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse‐induced bone loss. © 2017 The Authors JBMR Plus published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

RNAseq and RNA molecular barcoding reveal differential gene expression in cortical bone following hindlimb unloading in female mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8509868/,"Disuse-induced bone loss is seen following spinal cord injury, prolonged bed rest, and exposure to microgravity. We performed whole transcriptomic profiling of cortical bone using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding (NanoString) on a hindlimb unloading (HLU) mouse model to identify genes whose mRNA transcript abundances change in response to disuse. Eleven-week old female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ambulatory loading or HLU for 7 days (n = 8/group). Total RNA from marrow-flushed femoral cortical bone was analyzed on HiSeq and NanoString platforms. The expression of several previously reported genes associated with Wnt signaling and metabolism was altered by HLU. Furthermore, the increased abundance of transcripts, such as Pfkfb3 and Mss51, after HLU imply these genes also have roles in the cortical bone’s response to altered mechanical loading.

Proteomic and phosphoproteomic characterization of cardiovascular tissues after long term exposure to simulated space radiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11063234/,"Introduction: It may take decades to develop cardiovascular dysfunction following exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation from medical therapy or from nuclear accidents. Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions. Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a single dose of simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR 5-ion ) develop cardiovascular dysfunction by 12 months post-radiation. Methods: To investigate the biological basis of this dysfunction, here we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from these mice at 8 months post-radiation. Results: Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) for irradiated versus sham irradiated samples (fold-change ≥1.2 and an adjusted p -value of ≤0.05) were identified for each proteomics data set. For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (11 upregulated and 76 downregulated); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (17 upregulated and 43 downregulated); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) technique that assesses canonical pathways from BIOCARTA, KEGG, PID, REACTOME, and WikiPathways revealed significant perturbation in pathways in each data set. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were significantly altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways significantly altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways significantly affected at 0.1 adjusted p -value cutoff. Pathways related to inflammation were the most highly perturbed in the heart and plasma. In line with sustained inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were demonstrated to be increased in GCR 5-ion irradiated hearts at 12-month post irradiation. NETs play a fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens, modulating inflammatory responses, inflicting damage on healthy tissues, and escalating vascular thrombosis. Discussion: These findings suggest that a single exposure to GCR 5-ion results in long-lasting changes in the proteome and that these proteomic changes can potentiate acute and chronic health issues for astronauts, such as what we have previously described with late cardiac dysfunction in these mice.

Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups.

Here we present an anatomical description of this structure in the adult oyster toadfish, and establish a morphological basis for interpretation of subsequent functional studies. Light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to visualize the sensory epithelium at varying levels of detail, its neural innervation and its synaptic organization. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize otolith mass and morphological polarization patterns of hair cells. Afferent nerve fibers were visualized following labeling with biocytin, and light microscope images were used to make three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of individual labeled afferents to identify dendritic morphology with respect to epithelial location. Transmission electron micrographs were compiled to create a serial 3-D reconstruction of a labeled afferent over a segment of its dendritic field and to examine the cell-afferent synaptic contacts. Major observations are: a well-defined striola, medial and lateral extra-striolar regions with a zonal organization of hair bundles; prominent lacinia projecting laterally; dependence of hair cell density on macular location; narrow afferent dendritic fields that follow the hair bundle polarization; synaptic specializations issued by afferents are typically directed towards a limited number of 7–13 hair cells, but larger dendritic fields in the medial extra-striola can be associated with > 20 hair cells also; and hair cell synaptic bodies can be confined to only an individual afferent or can synapse upon several afferents.

"Influence of Magnitude and Duration of Altered Gravity and Readaptation to 1g on the Structure and Function of the Utricle in Toadfish, Opsanus tau.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204554/,"Gravity has remained constant during animal evolution and the neural sensory systems detecting acceleration forces have remained remarkably conserved among vertebrates. The utricular organ senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. Change in gravitational force would be expected to have profound effects on how an organism maintains equilibrium. We characterize the physiology of utricular afferents to applied accelerations in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau , in normal 1 g to establish benchmarks, after 1–32-day exposures to 2.24 g (resultant) via centrifugation (hypergravity, HG), after 4- and 16-day exposures to 1.12 g (resultant), and following 1–8 days recovery to HG exposures to study re-adaptation to 1 g. Afferents were also examined during activation of efferent vestibular pathway. Centrifugation at 2.24 g included 228°/s constant angular velocity component, and thus horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were recorded as an internal control in each fish. Afferents studied after 228°/s rotation for 4 and 16 days without centripetal acceleration, called On-Center-Control, were indistinguishable from their control counterparts. Principal response to HG was an adjustment of afferent sensitivity as a function of magnitude and duration of exposure: an initial robust increase at 3–4 days followed by a significant decrease from 16 to 32 days. Initial increase observed after 4 days of HG took >4 days in 1 g to recover, and the decrease observed after 16 days of HG took >2 days to readapt to 1 g. Hair cells in striola and medial extrastriola macula regions were serially reconstructed in 3D from thin sections using transmission electron microscopy in control fish and fish exposed to 4 and 16 days of HG. Despite the highly significant differences in afferent physiology, synaptic body counts quantified in the same fish were equivalent in their inter-animal variability and averages. No clear role of the efferent pathway as a feedback mechanism regulating afferent behavior to HG was found. Transfer from 1 g to HG imparts profound effects on gravitational sensitivity of utricular afferents and the accompanying transfer from the HG back to the 1 g resembles in part (as an analog) the transfer from 1 g to the micrograms.

Inter-regulation of the unfolded protein response and auxin signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3981873/,"SUMMARY The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling network triggered by overload of protein-folding demand in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition termed ER stress. The UPR is critical for growth and development; nonetheless, connections between the UPR and other cellular regulatory processes remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a link between the UPR and the phytohormone auxin, a master regulator of plant physiology. We show that ER stress triggers down-regulation of auxin sensors and transporters in Arabidopsis thaliana . We also demonstrate that an Arabidopsis mutant of a conserved ER stress sensor IRE1 exhibits defects in the auxin response and levels. These data not only support that the plant IRE1 is required for auxin homeostasis, they also reveal a species-specific feature of IRE1 in multicellular eukaryotes. Furthermore, by establishing that UPR activation is reduced in mutants of ER-localized auxin transporters, including PIN5, we define a long-neglected biological significance of ER-based auxin regulation.

Maintaining the factory: The roles of the unfolded protein response in cellular homeostasis in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5415411/,"Summary Much like a factory, the endoplasmic reticulum assembles simple cellular building blocks into complex molecular machines known as proteins. In order to protect the delicate protein folding process and ensure the proper cellular delivery of protein products under environmental stresses, eukaryotes have evolved a set of signaling mechanisms known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) to increase the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum. This process is particularly important in plants, because their sessile nature commands adaptation for survival rather than escape from stress. As such, plants make special use of the UPR, and evidence indicates that the master regulators and downstream effectors of the UPR have distinct roles in mediating cellular processes that affect organism growth and development as well as stress responses. In this review we outline recent developments in this field that support a strong relevance of the UPR to many areas of plant life.

NADPH oxidase activity is required for ER stress survival in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6289879/,"In all eukaryotes, the unfolded protein response (UPR) relieves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is a potentially lethal condition caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. In mammalian and yeast cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ER stress attenuate the UPR, negatively impacting cell survival. In plants, the relationship between the UPR and ROS is less clear. Although ROS develop during ER stress, the sources of ROS linked to ER stress responses and the physiological impact of ROS generation on the survival from proteotoxic stress are yet unknown. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana the respiratory burst oxidase homologs, RBOHD and RBOHF, contribute to the production of ROS during ER stress. We also demonstrate that during ER stress RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary to properly mount the adaptive UPR and overcome temporary and chronic ER stress situations. These results ascribe a cytoprotective role to RBOH-generated ROS in the defense from proteotoxic stress in an essential organelle, and support a plant-specific feature of the UPR management among eukaryotes.

Relevance of the Unfolded Protein Response to Spaceflight-Induced Transcriptional Reprogramming in Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7987364/,"Plants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be indispensable to the establishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stress, we examined the significance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . To do so, we performed a large-scale comparative transcriptome profiling in wild type and various UPR-defective mutants during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station. We established that orbital culture substantially alters the expression of hundreds of stress-related genes compared with ground control conditions. Although expression of those genes varied in the UPR mutants on the ground, it was largely similar across the genotypes in the spaceflight condition. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks.

DNA damage generated by HZE particles is more densely clustered than that generated by gamma rays. To understand the genetic requirements for resistance to high versus low LET radiation, a series of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants were exposed to either 1GeV Fe nuclei or gamma radiation. A comparison of effects on the germination and subsequent growth of seedlings led us to conclude that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the two types of radiation (HZE versus gamma) are roughly 3:1. Similarly, in wild-type lines, loss of somatic heterozygosity was induced at an RBE of about a 2:1 (HZE versus gamma). Checkpoint and repair defects, as expected, enhanced sensitivity to both agents.

Toward countering muscle and bone loss with spaceflight: GSK3 as a potential target,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10285634/,"Summary We examined the effects of ∼30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, rodent research [RR]1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3β content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3β was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight.

Spaceflight increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and this cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11271499/,"Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca 2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca 2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca 2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso -tetrakis( N -n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca 2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca 2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca 2+ leak.

Cardiovascular progenitor cells cultured aboard the International Space Station exhibit altered developmental and functional properties,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6062551/,"The heart and its cellular components are profoundly altered by missions to space and injury on Earth. Further research, however, is needed to characterize and address the molecular substrates of such changes. For this reason, neonatal and adult human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) were cultured aboard the International Space Station. Upon return to Earth, we measured changes in the expression of microRNAs and of genes related to mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. We additionally assessed endothelial-like tube formation, cell cycling, and migratory capacity of CPCs. Changes in microRNA expression were predicted to target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both neonatal and adult CPCs. Genes related to mechanotransduction ( YAP1, RHOA ) were downregulated, while the expression of cytoskeletal genes ( VIM , NES , DES , LMNB2 , LMNA ), non-canonical Wnt ligands ( WNT5A , WNT9A ), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules ( PLCG1 , PRKCA ) was significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs. Increased mesendodermal gene expression along with decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers ( TNNT2 , VWF , and RUNX2 ), reduced readiness to form endothelial-like tubes, and elevated expression of Bmp and Tbx genes, were observed in neonatal CPCs. Both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, which was supported by enhanced migration. While spaceflight affects cytoskeletal organization and migration in neonatal and adult CPCs, only neonatal CPCs experienced increased expression of early developmental markers and an enhanced proliferative potential.

Inter-agency perspective: Translating advances in biomarker discovery and medical countermeasures development between terrestrial and space radiation environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9832585/,"Over the past 20+ years, the U.S. Government has made significant strides in establishing research funding and initiating a portfolio consisting of subject matter experts on radiation-induced biological effects in normal tissues. Research supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provided much of the early findings on identifying cellular pathways involved in radiation injuries, due to the need to push the boundaries to kill tumor cells while minimizing damage to intervening normal tissues. By protecting normal tissue surrounding the tumors, physicians can deliver a higher radiation dose to tumors and reduce adverse effects related to the treatment. Initially relying on this critical NCI research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), first tasked with developing radiation medical countermeasures in 2004, has provided bridge funding to move basic research toward advanced development and translation. The goal of the NIAID program is to fund approaches that can one day be employed to protect civilian populations during a radiological or nuclear incident. In addition, with the reality of long-term space flights and the possibility of radiation exposures to both acute, high-intensity, and chronic lower-dose levels, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has identified requirements to discover and develop radioprotectors and mitigators to protect their astronauts during space missions.

The antiviral effects of the two lead compounds on mitigating virulent ASFV infection in porcine macrophages (PAMs) were also tested using similar methods, and the ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production during virulent ASFV infection was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results The screen identified five compounds that inhibited ASFV-induced CPE by greater than 50% and virus yield reduction experiments showed that two of these compounds, tetrandrine and berbamine, exhibited particularly high levels of anti-ASFV activity. Mechanistic analysis confirmed that both compounds potently inhibited early stages of ASFV infection and that the compounds also inhibited infection of PAMs by the virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate. Importantly, during ASFV infection in PAM cells, both compounds markedly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in disease pathogenesis while tetrandrine had a greater and more sustained anti-inflammatory effect than berbamine. Conclusions Together, these findings support that dual-acting natural compounds with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties hold promise as preventative and therapeutic agents to combat ASFV infection by simultaneously inhibiting viral replication and reducing virus-induced cytokine production.

Understanding macrophage differentiation during space flight: The importance of ground-based experiments before space flight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3890248/,"In preparation for a space flight on STS-126, two in vitro culture systems were used to investigate macrophage colony stimulating factor-dependent macrophage differentiation from mouse primary bone marrow cells. The patented Techshot Cell Cult Bioreactor and the BioServe Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA) 1 were operated in different orientations to determine their impact on macrophage growth and differentiation. Bone marrow cell parameters were determined after cells were grown in FPAs incubated at 37°C in vertical or horizontal orientations, and macrophage cell recovery was significantly higher from FPAs that were incubated in the horizontal orientation compared to “vertical” FPAs. Similarly, when bone marrow cells were grown in the Techshot bioreactor, there were significant differences in the numbers of macrophages recovered after 7 days, depending on movement and orientation of the bioreactor. Macrophage recovery was highest when the patented bioreactor was rotated in the horizontal, x-axis plane (merry-go-round fashion) compared to static and vertically, y-axis plane rotated (Ferris wheel fashion) bioreactors. In addition, the expression of F4/80 and other differentiation markers varied depending on whether macrophages differentiated in FPAs or in bioreactors. After 7 days, significant differences in size, granularity and molecule expression were seen even when the same primary bone marrow cells were used to seed the cultures. These data show that culture outcomes are highly dependent on the culture device and device orientation. Moreover, the impact of the culture system needs to be understood in order to interpret space flight data.

Bone marrow leptin signaling mediates obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation in male mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3868799/,"Obesity is characterized by an increased recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages to the adipose tissue (AT), leading to systemic inflammation and metabolic disease. The pathogenesis of this AT inflammation, however, remains to be elucidated. The circulating adipokine leptin is increased in obesity and is involved in immune cell function and activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of leptin in the induction of obesity-associated inflammation. We generated radiation chimeric C57BL/6J mice reconstituted with either leptin receptor-deficient ( db / db ) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and challenged them with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Mice reconstituted with db / db bone marrow (WT/db), had significantly lower body weight and adiposity compared with mice with WT bone marrow (WT/WT). Gonadal AT in WT/db mice displayed a 2-fold lower expression of the inflammatory genes Tnfa , Il6 , and Ccl2 . In addition, gonadal fat of WT/db mice contained significantly fewer crown-like structures compared with WT/WT mice, and most of their AT macrophages expressed macrophage galactose-type C type lectin 1 (MGL1) and were C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-negative, indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, WT/db mice exhibited greater insulin sensitivity compared with WT/WT mice. These data show that disrupted leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates the proinflammatory conditions that mediate many of the metabolic complications that characterize obesity.

Establishment and characterization of DB-1: a leptin receptor-deficient murine macrophage cell line,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4960141/,"Metabolic and immune mediators activate many of the same signal transduction pathways. Therefore, molecules that regulate metabolism often affect immune responses. Leptin is an adipokine that exemplifies this interplay. Leptin is the body’s major nutritional status sensor, but it also plays a key role in immune system regulation. To provide an in vitro tool to investigate the link between leptin and innate immunity, we immortalized and characterized a leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1. The cell line was created using bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice. Bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages by culturing them with recombinant mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor, and passaged when confluent for 6 months. The cells spontaneously immortalized at approximately passage 20. Cells were cloned twice by limiting dilution cloning prior to characterization. The macrophage cell line is diploid and grows at a linear rate for 4–5 days before reaching the growth plateau. The cells are MAC-2 and F4/80 positive and have phagocytic activity similar to primary macrophages from wild-type and leptin receptor-deficient mice. DB-1 cells were responsive to stimulation with interferon-γ as measured by increase in Nos2 transcript levels. In addition, DB-1 macrophages are not responsive to the chemotactic signaling of adipocyte conditioned media nor leptin when compared to primary WT macrophages. We believe that DB-1 cells provide a dependable tool to study the role of leptin or the leptin receptor in obesity-associated inflammation and immune system dysregulation.

Validation of methods to assess the immunoglobulin gene repertoire in tissues obtained from mice on the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5736159/,"Spaceflight is known to affect immune cell populations. In particular, splenic B cell numbers decrease during spaceflight and in ground-based physiological models. Although antibody isotype changes have been assessed during and after space flight, an extensive characterization of the impact of spaceflight on antibody composition has not been conducted in mice. Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatic tools are now available to assess antibody repertoires. We can now identify immunoglobulin gene- segment usage, junctional regions, and modifications that contribute to specificity and diversity. Due to limitations on the International Space Station, alternate sample collection and storage methods must be employed. Our group compared Illumina MiSeq sequencing data from multiple sample preparation methods in normal C57Bl/6J mice to validate that sample preparation and storage would not bias the outcome of antibody repertoire characterization. In this report, we also compared sequencing techniques and a bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and Igκ variable gene usage. This included assessments of our bioinformatic workflow on Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq datasets and is specifically designed to reduce bias, capture the most information from Ig sequences, and produce a data set that provides other data mining options.

We recovered over 90,000 heavy-chain and over 135,000 light-chain immunoglobulin sequences. Individual V-, D-, and J-gene segment usage was uniform among the three mouse pools, particularly in highly abundant gene segments, with low frequency V-gene segments not being detected in all pools. Despite the similar usage of individual gene segments, the repertoire of individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences in each mouse pool was highly varied, affirming the combinatorial diversity in the B-cell pool that has been previously demonstrated. There also was some skewing in the V-gene segments that were detected depending on chromosomal location.

Effects of spaceflight on the immunoglobulin repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5826609/,"Spaceflight has been shown to suppress the adaptive immune response, altering the distribution and function of lymphocyte populations. B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and Igκ gene loci were not increased.

A comparison of unamplified and massively multiplexed PCR amplification for murine antibody repertoire sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6366624/,"Sequencing antibody repertoires has steadily become cheaper and easier. Sequencing methods usually rely on some form of amplification, often a massively multiplexed PCR prior to sequencing. To eliminate potential biases and create a data set that could be used for other studies, our lab compared unamplified sequencing results from the splenic heavy-chain repertoire in the mouse to those processed through two commercial applications. We also compared the use of mRNA vs total RNA, reverse transcriptase, and primer usage for cDNA synthesis and submission. The use of mRNA for cDNA synthesis resulted in higher read counts but reverse transcriptase and primer usage had no statistical effects on read count. Although most of the amplified data sets contained more antibody reads than the unamplified data set, we detected more unique V-gene segments in the unamplified data set. Although unique CDR3 detection was much lower in the unamplified data set, RNASeq detected 98% of the high frequency CDR3s. We have shown that unamplified profiling of the antibody repertoire is possible, detects more V-gene segments, and detects high frequency clones in the repertoire.

A dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity was detected in FVIII knockout mice at a dose of 1.0 × 10 12 TAK-754 capsid particles (CP)/kg or higher. This increase was shown to be in accordance with a dose-dependent decrease in blood loss in a hemostatic efficacy assay.

An Analysis of the Effects of Spaceflight and Vaccination on Antibody Repertoire Diversity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10996920/,"Ab repertoire diversity plays a critical role in the host’s ability to fight pathogens. CDR3 is partially responsible for Ab–Ag binding and is a significant source of diversity in the repertoire. CDR3 diversity is generated during VDJ rearrangement because of gene segment selection, gene segment trimming and splicing, and the addition of nucleotides. We analyzed the Ab repertoire diversity across multiple experiments examining the effects of spaceflight on the Ab repertoire after vaccination. Five datasets from four experiments were analyzed using rank-abundance curves and Shannon indices as measures of diversity. We discovered a trend toward lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected differences in Shannon indices between experiments and tissues. We did not detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments.

Effects of spaceflight aboard the International Space Station on mouse estrous cycle and ovarian gene expression,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954810/,"Ovarian steroids dramatically impact normal homeostatic and metabolic processes of most tissues within the body, including muscle, bone, neural, immune, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. Determining the effects of spaceflight on the ovary and estrous cycle is, therefore, critical to our understanding of all spaceflight experiments using female mice. Adult female mice ( n = 10) were exposed to and sacrificed on-orbit after 37 days of spaceflight in microgravity. Contemporary control (preflight baseline, vivarium, and habitat; n = 10/group) groups were maintained at the Kennedy Space Center, prior to sacrifice and similar tissue collection at the NASA Ames Research Center. Ovarian tissues were collected and processed for RNA and steroid analyses at initial carcass thaw. Vaginal wall tissue collected from twice frozen/thawed carcasses was fixed for estrous cycle stage determinations. The proportion of animals in each phase of the estrous cycle (i.e., proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus) did not appreciably differ between baseline, vivarium, and flight mice, while habitat control mice exhibited greater numbers in diestrus. Ovarian tissue steroid concentrations indicated no differences in estradiol across groups, while progesterone levels were lower ( p < 0.05) in habitat and flight compared to baseline females. Genes involved in ovarian steroidogenic function were not differentially expressed across groups. As ovarian estrogen can dramatically impact multiple non-reproductive tissues, these data support vaginal wall estrous cycle classification of all female mice flown in space. Additionally, since females exposed to long-term spaceflight were observed at different estrous cycle stages, this indicates females are likely undergoing ovarian cyclicity and may yet be fertile.

Effect of spaceflight on Pseudomonas aeruginosa final cell density is modulated by nutrient and oxygen availability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4228280/,"Background Abundant populations of bacteria have been observed on Mir and the International Space Station. While some experiments have shown that bacteria cultured during spaceflight exhibit a range of potentially troublesome characteristics, including increases in growth, antibiotic resistance and virulence, other studies have shown minimal differences when cells were cultured during spaceflight or on Earth. Although the final cell density of bacteria grown during spaceflight has been reported for several species, we are not yet able to predict how different microorganisms will respond to the microgravity environment. In order to build our understanding of how spaceflight affects bacterial final cell densities, additional studies are needed to determine whether the observed differences are due to varied methods, experimental conditions, or organism specific responses. Results Here, we have explored how phosphate concentration, carbon source, oxygen availability, and motility affect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in modified artificial urine media during spaceflight. We observed that P. aeruginosa grown during spaceflight exhibited increased final cell density relative to normal gravity controls when low concentrations of phosphate in the media were combined with decreased oxygen availability. In contrast, when the availability of either phosphate or oxygen was increased, no difference in final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity. Because motility has been suggested to affect how microbes respond to microgravity, we compared the growth of wild-type P. aeruginosa to a Δ motABCD mutant deficient in swimming motility. However, the final cell densities observed with the motility mutant were consistent with those observed with wild type for all conditions tested. Conclusions These results indicate that differences in bacterial final cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. Further, our results suggest that microbes grown under nutrient-limiting conditions are likely to reach higher cell densities under microgravity conditions than they would on Earth. Considering that the majority of bacteria inhabiting spacecrafts and space stations are likely to live under nutrient limitations, our findings highlight the need to explore the impact microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment have on microbial growth and physiology.

Spaceflight promotes biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3639165/,"Understanding the effects of spaceflight on microbial communities is crucial for the success of long-term, manned space missions. Surface-associated bacterial communities, known as biofilms, were abundant on the Mir space station and continue to be a challenge on the International Space Station. The health and safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are of particular concern due to the suppression of immune function observed during spaceflight. While planktonic cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight on biofilm development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured during two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and STS-135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized. Spaceflight was observed to increase the number of viable cells, biofilm biomass, and thickness relative to normal gravity controls. Moreover, the biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a column-and-canopy structure that has not been observed on Earth. The increase in the amount of biofilms and the formation of the novel architecture during spaceflight were observed to be independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the media. However, flagella-driven motility was shown to be essential for the formation of this biofilm architecture during spaceflight. These findings represent the first evidence that spaceflight affects community-level behaviors of bacteria and highlight the importance of understanding how both harmful and beneficial human-microbe interactions may be altered during spaceflight.",understanding effects spaceflight microbial communities crucial success longterm manned space missions surfaceassociated bacterial communities known biofilms abundant mir space station continue challenge international space station health safety hazards linked development biofilms particular concern due suppression immune function observed spaceflight planktonic cultures microbes indicated spaceflight lead increases growth virulence effects spaceflight biofilm development physiology remain unclear address issue pseudomonas aeruginosa cultured two space shuttle atlantis missions sts sts biofilms formed spaceflight characterized spaceflight observed increase number viable cells biofilm biomass thickness relative normal gravity controls moreover biofilms formed spaceflight exhibited columnandcanopy structure observed earth increase amount biofilms formation novel architecture spaceflight observed independent carbon source phosphate concentrations media however flagelladriven motility shown essential formation biofilm architecture spaceflight findings represent first evidence spaceflight affects communitylevel behaviors bacteria highlight importance understanding harmful beneficial humanmicrobe interactions may altered spaceflight

Overall pathway analyses on the multi-omic datasets showed significant enrichment for mitochondrial processes, as well as innate immunity, chronic inflammation, cell cycle, circadian rhythm, and olfactory functions. Importantly, NASA’s Twin Study provided a platform to confirm several of our principal findings. Evidence of altered mitochondrial function and DNA damage was also found in the urine and blood metabolic data compiled from the astronaut cohort and NASA Twin Study data, indicating mitochondrial stress as a consistent phenotype of spaceflight.

A New Era for Space Life Science: International Standards for Space Omics Processing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733874/,"Summary Space agencies have announced plans for human missions to the Moon to prepare for Mars. However, the space environment presents stressors that include radiation, microgravity, and isolation. Understanding how these factors affect biology is crucial for safe and effective crewed space exploration. There is a need to develop countermeasures, to adapt plants and microbes for nutrient sources and bioregenerative life support, and to limit pathogen infection. Scientists across the world are conducting space omics experiments on model organisms and, more recently, on humans. Optimal extraction of actionable scientific discoveries from these precious datasets will only occur at the collective level with improved standardization. To address this shortcoming, we established ISSOP (International Standards for Space Omics Processing), an international consortium of scientists who aim to enhance standard guidelines between space biologists at a global level.

Spatially resolved multiomics on the neuronal effects induced by spaceflight in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166911/,"Impairment of the central nervous system (CNS) poses a significant health risk for astronauts during long-duration space missions. In this study, we employed an innovative approach by integrating single-cell multiomics (transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the impact of spaceflight on the mouse brain in female mice. Our comparative analysis between ground control and spaceflight-exposed animals revealed significant alterations in essential brain processes including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission, particularly affecting the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and neuroendocrine structures. Additionally, we observed astrocyte activation and signs of immune dysfunction. At the pathway level, some spaceflight-induced changes in the brain exhibit similarities with neurodegenerative disorders, marked by oxidative stress and protein misfolding. Our integrated spatial multiomics approach serves as a stepping stone towards understanding spaceflight-induced CNS impairments at the level of individual brain regions and cell types, and provides a basis for comparison in future spaceflight studies.

NASA GeneLab derived microarray studies of Mus musculus and Homo sapiens organisms in altered gravitational conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11053165/,"One of the greatest challenges of humanity for deep space exploration is to fully understand how altered gravitational conditions affect human physiology. It is evident that the spaceflight environment causes multiple alterations to musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, immune and central nervous systems, to name a few known effects. To better characterize these biological effects, we compare gene expression datasets from microarray studies found in NASA GeneLab, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository. In this review, we summarize these archived results for various tissues, emphasizing key genes which are highly reproducible in different mice or human experiments. Such exhaustive mining shows the potential of NASA Open Science data to identify and validate mechanisms taking place when mammalian organisms are exposed to microgravity or other spaceflight conditions. Our comparative meta-analysis findings highlight certain degrees of overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as differentially expressed within musculoskeletal tissues in each species across a variety of altered gravity conditions.

Dichotomous effects on lymphatic transport with loss of caveolae in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8513672/,"Aim: Fluid and macromolecule transport from the interstitium into and through lymphatic vessels is necessary for tissue homeostasis. While lymphatic capillary structure suggests that passive, paracellular transport would be the predominate route of macromolecule entry, active caveolae-mediated transcellular transport has been identified in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in vitro. Caveolae also mediate a wide array of endothelial cell processes, including nitric oxide regulation. Thus, how does the lack of caveolae impact “lymphatic function”? Methods: Various aspects of lymphatic transport were measured in mice constitutively lacking caveolin-1 (“CavKO”), the protein required for caveolae formation in endothelial cells, and in mice with a LEC-specific Cav1 gene deletion (Lyve1-Cre x Cav1 flox/flox ; “LyCav”) and ex vivo in their vessels and cells. Results: In each model, lymphatic architecture was largely unchanged. The lymphatic conductance, or initial tissue uptake, was significantly higher in both CavKO mice and LyCav mice by quantitative microlymphangiography and the permeability to 70kDa dextran was significantly increased in monolayers of LECs isolated from CavKO mice. Conversely, transport within the lymphatic system to the sentinel node was significantly reduced in anesthetized CavKO and LyCav mice. Isolated, cannulated collecting vessel studies identified significantly reduced phasic contractility when lymphatic endothelium lacks caveolae. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase was able to partially restore ex vivo vessel contractility. Conclusion: Macromolecule transport across lymphatics is increased with loss of caveolae, yet phasic contractility reduced, resulting in reduced overall lymphatic transport function. These studies identify lymphatic caveolar biology as a key regulator of active lymphatic transport functions.

Fungal diversity differences in the indoor dust microbiome from built environments on Earth and in space.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11126634/,"Human occupied built environments are no longer confined to Earth. In fact, there have been humans living and working in low-Earth orbit on the International Space Station (ISS) since November 2000. With NASA’s Artemis missions and the age of commercial space stations set to begin, more human-occupied spacecraft than ever will be in Earth’s orbit and beyond. On Earth and in the ISS, microbes, especially fungi, can be found in dust and grow when unexpected, elevated moisture conditions occur. However, we do not yet know how indoor microbiomes in Earth-based homes and in the ISS differ due to their unique set of environmental conditions. Here we show that bacterial and fungal communities are different in dust collected from vacuum bags on Earth and the ISS, with Earth-based homes being more diverse (465 fungal OTUs and 237 bacterial ASVs) compared to the ISS (102 fungal OTUs and 102 bacterial ASVs). When dust from these locations were exposed to varying equilibrium relative humidity conditions (ERH), there were also significant fungal community composition changes as ERH and time elevated increased (Bray Curtis: R 2 = 0.35, P = 0.001). These findings can inform future spacecraft design to promote healthy indoor microbiomes that support crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection.

Predicting how varying moisture conditions impact the microbiome of dust collected from the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11386075/,"Background The commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces. Results Here, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4 × 10 6 spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 × 10 10 when exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha ( Q < 0.05) and beta ( R 2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta ( R 2 = 0.22, P = 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity ( Q < 0.05). Conclusion Our results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.

Aging and estrogen status: A possible endothelium-dependent vascular coupling mechanism in bone remodeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3502426/,"Bone loss with aging and menopause may be linked to vascular endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of the study was to determine whether putative modifications in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) with altered estrogen status in young (6 mon) and old (24 mon) female Fischer-344 rats. Animals were divided into 6 groups: 1) young intact, 2) old intact, 3) young ovariectomized (OVX), 4) old OVX, 5) young OVX plus estrogen replacement (OVX+E2), and 6) old OVX+E2. PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed in vitro using acetylcholine. Trabecular bone volume of the distal femoral metaphysis was determined by microCT. In young rats, vasodilation was diminished by OVX and restored with estrogen replacement (intact, 82±7; OVX, 61±9; OVX+E2, 90±4%), which corresponded with similar modifications in BV/TV (intact, 28.7±1.6; OVX, 16.3±0.9; OVX+E2, 25.7±1.4%). In old animals, vasodilation was unaffected by OVX but enhanced with estrogen replacement (intact, 55±8; OVX, 59±7; OVX+E2, 92±4%). Likewise, modifications in BV/TV followed the same pattern (intact, 33.1±1.6; OVX, 34.4±3.7; OVX+E2, 42.4±2.1%). Furthermore, in old animals with low endogenous estrogen (i.e., intact and old OVX), vasodilation was correlated with BV/TV (R 2 = 0.630; P<0.001).

Chronic skeletal unloading of the rat femur: mechanisms and functional consequences of vascular remodeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3856860/,"Chronic skeletal unloading diminishes hindlimb bone blood flow. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine 1) whether 7 and 14 days of skeletal unloading alters femoral bone and marrow blood flow and vascular resistance during reloading, and 2) whether putative changes in bone perfusion are associated with a gross structural remodeling of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur. Six-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 7-d or 14-d hindlimb unloading (HU) or weight-bearing control groups. Bone perfusion was measured following 10 min of standing (reloading) following the unloading treatment. Histomorphometry was used to determine PNA media wall thickness and maximal diameter. Bone blood flow, arterial pressure and PNA structural characteristics were used to calculate arterial shear stress and circumferential wall stress. During reloading, femoral perfusion was lower in the distal metaphyseal region of 7-d HU rats, and in the proximal and distal metaphyses, diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow of 14-d HU animals relative to that in control rats. Vascular resistance was also higher in all regions of the femur in 14-d HU rats during reloading relative to control animals. Intraluminal diameter of PNAs from 14-d HU rats (138 ± 5 μm) was smaller than that of control PNAs (162 ± 6 μm), and medial wall thickness was thinner in PNAs from 14-d HU (14.3 ± 0.6 μm) versus that of control (18.0 ± 0.8 μm) rats. Decreases in both shear stress and circumferential stress occurred in the PNA with HU that later returned to control levels with the reductions in PNA maximal diameter and wall thickness, respectively. The results demonstrate that chronic skeletal unloading attenuates the ability to increase blood flow and nutrient delivery to bone and marrow with immediate acute reloading due, in part, to a remodeling of the bone resistance vasculature.

Differential effects of aging and exercise on intra-abdominal adipose arteriolar function and blood flow regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3615599/,"Adipose tissue (AT), which typically comprises an increased percentage of body mass with advancing age, receives a large proportion of resting cardiac output. During exercise, an old age-associated inability to increase vascular resistance within the intra-abdominal AT may compromise the ability of the cardiovascular system to redistribute blood flow to the active musculature, contributing to the decline in exercise capacity observed in this population. We tested the hypotheses that 1 ) there would be an elevated perfusion of AT during exercise with old age that was associated with diminished vasoconstrictor responses of adipose-resistance arteries, and 2 ) chronic exercise training would mitigate the age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vascular function. Young (6 mo; n = 40) and old (24 mo; n = 28) male Fischer 344 rats were divided into young sedentary (YSed), old sedentary (OSed), young exercise trained (YET), or old exercise trained (OET) groups, where training consisted of 10-12 wk of treadmill exercise. In vivo blood flow at rest and during exercise and in vitro α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstrictor responses in resistance arteries from AT were measured in all groups. In response to exercise, there was a directionally opposite change in AT blood flow in the OSed group (∼150% increase) and YSed (∼55% decrease) vs. resting values. Both α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction were diminished in OSed vs. YSed AT-resistance arteries. Exercise training resulted in a similar AT hyperemic response between age groups during exercise (YET, 9.9 ± 0.5 ml·min −1 ·100 −1 g; OET, 8.1 ± 0.9 ml·min −1 ·100 −1 g) and was associated with enhanced myogenic and α-adrenergic vasoconstriction of AT-resistance arteries from the OET group relative to OSed. These results indicate that there is an inability to increase vascular resistance in AT during exercise with old age, due, in part, to a diminished vasoconstriction of AT arteries. Furthermore, the results indicate that exercise training can augment vasoconstriction of AT arteries and mitigate age-related alterations in the regulation of AT blood flow during exercise.

Effects of spaceflight and ground recovery on mesenteric artery and vein constrictor properties in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4050424/,"Following exposure to microgravity, there is a reduced ability of astronauts to augment peripheral vascular resistance, often resulting in orthostatic hypotension. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that mesenteric arteries and veins will exhibit diminished vasoconstrictor responses after spaceflight. Mesenteric arteries and veins from female mice flown on the Space Transportation System (STS)-131 ( n =11), STS-133 ( n =6), and STS-135 ( n =3) shuttle missions and respective ground-based control mice ( n =30) were isolated for in vitro experimentation. Vasoconstrictor responses were evoked in arteries via norepinephrine (NE), potassium chloride (KCl), and caffeine, and in veins through NE across a range of intraluminal pressures (2–12 cmH 2 O). Vasoconstriction to NE was also determined in mesenteric arteries at 1, 5, and 7 d postlanding. In arteries, maximal constriction to NE, KCl, and caffeine were reduced immediately following spaceflight and 1 d postflight. Spaceflight also reduced arterial ryanodine receptor-3 mRNA levels. In mesenteric veins, there was diminished constriction to NE after flight. The results indicate that the impaired vasoconstriction following spaceflight occurs through the ryanodine receptor-mediated intracellular Ca 2+ release mechanism. Such vascular changes in astronauts could compromise the maintenance of arterial pressure during orthostatic stress.—Behnke, B. J., Stabley, J. N., McCullough, D. J., Davis, R. T., III, Dominguez, J.

"Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: Implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3659353/,"Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice ( n =7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice ( n =12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236±9 μm and GC: 215±5 μm) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4±1.6 μm; GC: 12.2±1.2 μm). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4±0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4±0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight.—Taylor, C.

Exercise training augments regional bone and marrow blood flow during exercise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4169763/,"Introduction The principal nutrient artery to the femur demonstrates an increase in nitric oxide mediated vasodilation in rats after treadmill exercise training. The present study sought to determine whether exercise training improves hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow distribution at rest and during exercise. Methods Six-eight month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were exercise trained (ET) with treadmill walking at 15 m/min up a 15° incline for 60 min/d over a 10–12 wk period. Sedentary (SED) control animals were acclimated to treadmill exercise for 5 min/d during the week preceding the blood flow measurements. Blood flow to nine distinct regions of the femur, tibia, and fibula were determined at rest and during low-intensity exercise (15 m/min walking, 0° incline) using the reference sample microsphere method. Results The results demonstrate an augmentation of exercise hyperemia above that observed in SED rats during exercise in only one region of bone, the femoral diaphysis of ET rats. However, while exercise hyperemia occurred in 3 of the 9 hindlimb bone regions measured in SED rats, exercise hyperemia occurred in 7 of 9 regions in ET rats. Conclusion These data indicate an increase in generalized hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow during physical activity following a period of exercise training. Elevations in regional bone and marrow blood flow after training may augment medullary pressure and bone interstitial fluid flow, thus benefiting bone integrity.

Effects of Skeletal Unloading on the Vasomotor Properties of the Rat Femur Principal Nutrient Artery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4398884/,"Spaceflight and prolonged bed rest induce deconditioning of the cardiovascular system and bone loss. Previous research has shown declines in femoral bone and marrow perfusion during unloading and with subsequent reloading in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rats, an animal model of chronic disuse. We hypothesized that the attenuated bone and marrow perfusion may result from altered vasomotor properties of the bone resistance vasculature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of unloading on the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA), the main conduit for blood flow to the femur, in 2 wk HU and control (CON) rats. Vasoconstriction of the femoral PNA was assessed in vitro using norepinephrine, phenylephrine, clonidine, KCl, endothelin-1, arginine vasopressin, and myogenic responsiveness. Vasodilation through endothelium-dependent [acetylcholine, bradykinin, and flow-mediated dilation (FMD)] and endothelium-independent mechanisms [sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and adenosine] were also determined. Vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the PNA from HU rats was not enhanced through any of the mechanisms tested. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine (CON, 86 ± 3%; HU, 48 ± 7% vasodilation) and FMD (CON, 61 ± 9%; HU, 11 ± 11% vasodilation) were attenuated in PNAs from HU rats, while responses to bradykinin were not different between groups. Endothelium-independent vasodilation to SNP and adenosine were not different between groups. These data indicate that unloading-induced decrements in bone and marrow perfusion and increases in vascular resistance are not the result of enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the bone resistance arteries but are associated with reductions in endothelium-dependent vasodilation.

Type 2 diabetes alters bone and marrow blood flow and vascular control mechanisms in the ZDF rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4379453/,"Bone health and cardiovascular function are compromised in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether skeletal vascular control mechanisms are altered during the progression of T2DM in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat. Responses of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur from obese ZDF rats with prediabetes, short-term diabetes, and long-term diabetes to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and –independent (sodium nitroprusside) vasodilation, and KCl, norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstrictor were determined in vitro . Few changes in the PNA vasomotor responses occurred in the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic conditions. Endothelium-dependent and –independent vasodilation were reduced, and norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstriction were enhanced in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes relative to lean age-matched controls. Differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA between ZDF rats and controls were abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N G -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. The passive pressure-diameter response of the femoral PNA was also lower across a range of intraluminal pressures with long-term T2DM. Regional bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance, measured in vivo using radiolabeled microspheres, were lower in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes. These findings suggest that the profound impairment of the bone circulation may contribute to the osteopenia found to occur in long bones with chronic T2DM.

Spaceflight on the Bion-M1 biosatellite alters cerebral artery vasomotor and mechanical properties in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4385880/,"Conditions during spaceflight, such as the loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector, are thought to potentially alter cerebral blood flow and vascular resistance. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of long-term spaceflight on the functional, mechanical, and structural properties of cerebral arteries. Male C57BL/6N mice were flown 30 days in a Bion-M1 biosatellite. Basilar arteries isolated from spaceflight (SF) ( n = 6), habitat control (HC) ( n = 6), and vivarium control (VC) ( n = 16) mice were used for in vitro functional and mechanical testing and histological structural analysis. The results demonstrate that vasoconstriction elicited through a voltage-gated Ca 2+ mechanism (30–80 mM KCl) and thromboxane A 2 receptors (10 −8 − 3 × 10 −5 M U46619) are lower in cerebral arteries from SF mice. Inhibition of Rho-kinase activity (1 μM Y27632) abolished group differences in U46619-evoked contractions. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation elicited by acetylcholine (10 μM, 2 μM U46619 preconstriction) was virtually absent in cerebral arteries from SF mice. The pressure-diameter relation was lower in arteries from SF mice relative to that in HC mice, which was not related to differences in the extracellular matrix protein elastin or collagen content or the elastin/collagen ratio in the basilar arteries. Diameter, medial wall thickness, and medial cross-sectional area of unpressurized basilar arteries were not different among groups. These results suggest that the microgravity-induced attenuation of both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties may limit the range of vascular control of cerebral perfusion or impair the distribution of brain blood flow during periods of stress.

Apollo Lunar Astronauts Show Higher Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: Possible Deep Space Radiation Effects on the Vascular Endothelium,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4964660/,"As multiple spacefaring nations contemplate extended manned missions to Mars and the Moon, health risks could be elevated as travel goes beyond the Earth’s protective magnetosphere into the more intense deep space radiation environment. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth’s magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4–5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction.

Effects of age and exercise training on coronary microvascular smooth muscle phenotype and function,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5866446/,"Coronary microvascular function and blood flow responses during acute exercise are impaired in the aged heart but can be restored by exercise training. Coronary microvascular resistance is directly dependent on vascular smooth muscle function in coronary resistance arterioles; therefore, we hypothesized that age impairs contractile function and alters the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle in coronary arterioles. We further hypothesized that exercise training restores contractile function and reverses age-induced phenotypic alterations of arteriolar smooth muscle. Young and old Fischer 344 rats underwent 10 wk of treadmill exercise training or remained sedentary. At the end of training or cage confinement, contractile responses, vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and expression of contractile proteins were assessed in isolated coronary arterioles. Both receptor- and non-receptor-mediated contractile function were impaired in coronary arterioles from aged rats. Vascular smooth muscle shifted from a differentiated, contractile phenotype to a secretory phenotype with associated proliferation of smooth muscle in the arteriolar wall. Expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 1 (SM1) was decreased in arterioles from aged rats, whereas expression of phospho-histone H3 and of the synthetic protein ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) were increased. Exercise training improved contractile responses, reduced smooth muscle proliferation and expression of rpS6, and increased expression of SM1 in arterioles from old rats. Thus age-induced contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and emergence of a secretory smooth muscle phenotype may contribute to impaired coronary blood flow responses, but arteriolar contractile responsiveness and a younger smooth muscle phenotype can be restored with late-life exercise training. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Aging impairs contractile function of coronary arterioles and induces a shift of the vascular smooth muscle toward a proliferative, noncontractile phenotype. Late-life exercise training reverses contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and restores a young phenotype to the vascular smooth muscle.

Impact of Spaceflight and Artificial Gravity on the Mouse Retina: Biochemical and Proteomic Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6165321/,"Astronauts are reported to have experienced some impairment in visual acuity during their mission on the International Space Station (ISS) and after they returned to Earth. There is emerging evidence that changes in vision may involve alterations in ocular structure and function. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles and oxidative stress-associated apoptosis were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 mice ( n = 12) were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX rocket to the ISS for a 35-day mission. The animals were housed in the mouse Habitat Cage Unit (HCU) in the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) “Kibo” facility on the ISS. The flight mice lived either under an ambient microgravity condition (µg) or in a centrifugal habitat unit that produced 1 g artificial gravity (µg + 1 g ). Habitat control (HC) and vivarium control mice lived on Earth in HCUs or normal vivarium cages, respectively. Quantitative assessment of ocular tissue demonstrated that the µg group induced significant apoptosis in the retina vascular endothelial cells compared to all other groups ( p < 0.05) that was 64% greater than that in the HC group. Proteomic analysis showed that many key pathways responsible for cell death, cell repair, inflammation, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in µg mice compared to HC animals. Additionally, there were more significant changes in regulated protein expression in the µg group relative to that in the µg + 1 g group. These data provide evidence that spaceflight induces retinal apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and changes in retinal protein expression related to cellular structure, immune response and metabolic function, and that artificial gravity (AG) provides some protection against these changes. These retinal cellular responses may affect blood–retinal barrier (BRB) integrity, visual acuity, and impact the potential risk of developing late retinal degeneration.

Simulated microgravity induces regionally distinct neurovascular and structural remodeling of skeletal muscle and cutaneous arteries in the rat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7339929/,"Introduction : Mechanical forces and sympathetic influences are key determinants of vascular structure and function. This study tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading (HU) exerts diverse effects on forelimb and hindlimb small arteries of rats in functionally different regions of the skeletal muscle and skin. Methods : Male Wistar rats were subjected to HU for 2 weeks, then skeletal muscle arteries (deep brachial and sural) and skin arteries (median and saphenous) were examined in vitro using wire myography or isobaric perfusion and glyoxylic acid staining. Results : HU increased lumen diameter of both forelimb arteries but decreased diameter of the sural artery; the saphenous artery diameter was not affected. Following HU, maximal contractile responses to noradrenaline and serotonin increased in the forelimb but decreased in the hindlimb skeletal muscle feed arteries with no change in skin arteries; all region-specific alterations persisted after endothelium removal. HU increased the sensitivity to vasoconstrictors in the saphenous artery but not in the sural artery. In the saphenous artery, initially high sympathetic innervation density was reduced by HU, sparse innervation in the sural artery was not affected. Electrical stimulation of periarterial sympathetic nerves in isobarically perfused segments of the saphenous artery demonstrated a two-fold decrease of the contractile responses in HU rats compared to that of controls. Conclusion : HU induces contrasting structural and functional adaptations in forelimb and hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries. Additionally, HU had diverse effects in two hindlimb vascular regions. Hyper-sensitivity of the saphenous artery to vasoconstrictors appears to result from the shortage of trophic sympathetic influence. Importantly, HU impaired sympathetically induced arterial vasoconstriction, consistent with the decreased sympathetic constrictor response in humans following space flight.

Spaceflight decelerates the epigenetic clock orchestrated with a global alteration in DNA methylome and transcriptome in the mouse retina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8220224/,"Astronauts exhibit an assortment of clinical abnormalities in their eyes during long-duration spaceflight.

The mice were flown for 37 days in animal enclosure modules on the International Space Station; ground-based control animals were maintained under similar housing conditions. Mouse retinas were isolated and both DNA methylome and transcriptome were determined by deep sequencing. We found that a large number of genes were differentially methylated with spaceflight, whereas there were fewer differentially expressed genes at the transcriptome level. Several biological pathways involved in retinal diseases such as macular degeneration were significantly altered. Our results indicated that spaceflight decelerated the retinal epigenetic clock.

Development of otolith receptors in Japanese quail.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910419/,"The present study examined the morphological development of the otolith vestibular receptors in quail. Here we describe epithelial growth, hair cell density, stereocilia polarization, and afferent nerve innervation during development. The otolith maculae epithelial areas increased exponentially throughout embryonic development reaching asymptotic values near post-hatch day P7. Increases in hair cell density were dependent upon macular location; striolar hair cells developed first followed by hair cells in extrastriola regions. Stereocilia polarization was initiated early, with defining reversal zones forming at E8. Less than half of all immature hair cells observed had non-polarized internal kinocilia with the remaining exhibiting planar polarity. Immunohistochemistry and neural tracing techniques were employed to examine the shape and location of the striolar regions. Initial innervation of the maculae was by small fibers with terminal growth cones at E6, followed by collateral branches with apparent bouton terminals at E8. Calyceal terminal formation began at E10, however no mature calyces were observed until E12, when all fibers appeared to be dimorphs. Calyx afferents innervating only type I hair cells did not develop until E14. Finally, the topographic organization of afferent macular innervation in the adult quail utricle was quantified. Calyx and dimorph afferents were primarily confined to the striolar regions, while bouton fibers were located in the extrastriola and type II band. Calyx fibers were the least complex, followed by dimorph units. Bouton fibers had large innervation fields, with arborous branches and many terminal boutons.

Spatial and temporal characteristics of vestibular convergence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166430/,"In all species studied, afferents from semicircular canals and otolith organs converge on central neurons in the brainstem. However, the spatial and temporal relationships between converging inputs and how these contribute to vestibular behaviors is not well understood. In the current study, we used discrete rotational and translational motion stimuli to characterize canal- and otolith-driven response components of convergent non-eye movement (NEM) neurons in the vestibular nuclear complex of alert pigeons. When compared to afferent responses, convergent canal signals had similar gain and phase ranges but exhibited greater spatial variability in their axes of preferred rotation. Convergent otolith signals also had similar mean gain and phase values to the afferent population but were spatially well-matched with the corresponding canal signals, cell-by-cell. However, neither response component alone nor a simple linear combination of these components was sufficient to predict actual net responses during combined canal-otolith stimulation. We discuss these findings in the context of previous studies of pigeon vestibular behaviors, and we compare our findings to similar studies in other species.

Bone remodeling is regulated by inner ear vestibular signals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6615562/,"Bone remodeling of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule is highly restricted and tightly controlled by the osteoprotegerin (OPG) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) system. In these bony structures, a pathological decrease in OPG expression stimulates osteoclast differentiation and excessive resorption followed by accrual of sclerotic bone, ultimately resulting in the development of otosclerosis, a leading cause of deafness in adults. Understanding the signaling pathways involved in maintaining OPG expression in the ear would shed light on the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other ear bone-related diseases. We and others previously demonstrated that Ca 2+ signaling through the L-type Ca V 1.2 Ca 2+ channel positively regulates OPG expression and secretion in long bone osteoblasts and their precursor cells in vitro and in vivo. Whether Ca V 1.2 regulates OPG expression in ear bones has not been investigated. We drove expression of a gain-of-function Ca V 1.2 mutant channel (Ca V 1.2 TS ) using Col2a1-Cre, which we found to target osteochondral/osteoblast progenitors in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS mice displayed osteopetrosis of these bones shown by μCT 3D reconstruction, histological analysis, and lack of bone sculpting, findings similar to phenotypes seen in mice with an osteoclast defect. Consistent with those observations, we found that Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS mutant mice showed reduced osteoclasts in the otic capsule, upregulated mRNA expression of Opg and Opg/Rankl ratio, and increased mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in the otic capsule, suggesting both an anti-catabolic and anabolic effect of Ca V 1.2 TS mutant channel contributed to the observed morphological changes of the ear bones. Further, we found that Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS mice experienced hearing loss and displayed defects of body balance in behavior tests, confirming that the Ca V 1.2-dependent Ca 2+ influx affects bone structure in the ear and consequent hearing and vestibular functions. Together, these data support our hypothesis that Ca 2+ influx through Ca V 1.2 TS promotes OPG expression from osteoblasts, thereby affecting bone modeling/remodeling in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. These data provide insight into potential pathological mechanisms underlying perturbed OPG expression and otosclerosis.

Simulated Microgravity Enhances Oligodendrocyte Mitochondrial Function and Lipid Metabolism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324008/,"The primary energy sources of mammalian cells are proteins, fats and sugars that are processed by well-known biochemical mechanisms that have been discovered and studied in 1G (terrestrial gravity). Here we sought to determine how simulated microgravity (sim-μG) impacts both energy and lipid metabolism in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We report increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis 24 hours after exposure to sim-μG. Moreover, examination of the secretome after three days exposure of OLs to sim-μG confirmed increased the Krebs cycle ( Krebs & Weitzman et al., 1987 ), flux in sim-μG. The secretome study also revealed a significant increase in the synthesis of fatty acids and complex lipids such as, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-GPC (5.67), lysolipids like 1-oleoyl-GPE (4.48) were also increased by microgravity.

Human Neural Stem Cells Flown into Space Proliferate and Generate Young Neurons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8412175/,"Here we demonstrate that human neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferate while in space and they express specific NSC markers after being in space. NSCs displayed both higher oxygen consumption and glycolysis than ground controls. These cells also kept their ability to become young neurons. Electrophysiological recordings of space NSC-derived neurons showed immature cell membrane properties characterized by small capacitance and very high input resistance. Current injections elicited only an incipient action potential. No spontaneous synaptic events could be detected, suggesting their immature status even though most recorded cells displayed complex morphology and numerous cell processes. Ascertaining the origin of the NSCs′ increased energy requirement is of the essence in order to design effective measures to minimize health risks associated with long-duration human spaceflight missions.

Space Microgravity Alters Neural Stem Cell Division: Implications for Brain Cancer Research on Earth and in Space,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9699585/,"Considering the imminence of long-term space travel, it is necessary to investigate the impact of space microgravity (SPC-µG) in order to determine if this environment has consequences on the astronauts’ health, in particular, neural and cognitive functions. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the basis for the regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) cell populations and learning how weightlessness impacts NSCs in health and disease provides a critical tool for the potential mitigation of specific mechanisms leading to neurological disorders. In previous studies, we found that exposure to SPC-µG resulted in enhanced proliferation, a shortened cell cycle, and a larger cell diameter of NSCs compared to control cells. Here, we report the frequent occurrence of abnormal cell division (ACD) including incomplete cell division (ICD), where cytokinesis is not successfully completed, and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD) of NSCs following SPC-µG as well as secretome exposure compared to ground control (1G) NSCs. These findings provide new insights into the potential health implications of space travel and have far-reaching implications for understanding the mechanisms leading to the deleterious effects of long-term space travel as well as potential carcinogenic susceptibility. Knowledge of these mechanisms could help to develop preventive or corrective measures for successful long-term SPC-µG exposure.

Oligodendrocyte Progenitors Display Enhanced Proliferation and Autophagy after Space Flight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9953055/,"Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) are some of the consequences of long-term space missions.

Nonetheless, a subpopulation of OLPs flown to space presented a significant increase in autophagic cell death. Examination of the proteomic profile of the secretome of space flown OLPs (SPC-OLPs) revealed that the stress protein heat shock protein-90 beta “HSP-90β” was the 5 th most enriched (6.8 times) and the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine “SPARC” was the 7 th most enriched (5.2 times), with respect to ground control cells.

We report increased glutamate and energy metabolism while the OLPs were in space for 26 days. We also show that after space flight, OLPs (SPC OLPs) display significantly increased mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis.

Spaceflight Induces Specific Alterations in the Proteomes of Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4290804/,"Life in spaceflight demonstrates remarkable acclimation processes within the specialized habitats of vehicles subjected to the myriad of unique environmental issues associated with orbital trajectories. To examine the response processes that occur in plants in space, leaves and roots from Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) seedlings from three GFP reporter lines that were grown from seed for 12 days on the International Space Station and preserved on orbit in RNAlater were returned to Earth and analyzed by using iTRAQ broad-scale proteomics procedures. Using stringent criteria, we identified over 1500 proteins, which included 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins we were able to accurately quantify. Quantification revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins that showed statistically significant differential abundance in the spaceflight samples compared to ground controls, with few proteins differentially regulated in common between leaves and roots. This indicates that there are measurable proteomics responses to spaceflight and that the responses are organ-specific. These proteomics data were compared with transcriptome data from similar spaceflight samples, showing that there is a positive but limited relationship between transcriptome and proteome regulation of the overall spaceflight responses of plants. These results are discussed in terms of emergence understanding of plant responses to spaceflight particularly with regard to cell wall remodeling, as well as in the context of deriving multiple omics data sets from a single on-orbit preservation and operations approach.

The effect of spaceflight on the gravity-sensing auxin gradient of roots: GFP reporter gene microscopy on orbit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515520/,"Our primary aim was to determine whether gravity has a direct role in establishing the auxin-mediated gravity-sensing system in primary roots. Major plant architectures have long been thought to be guided by gravity, including the directional growth of the primary root via auxin gradients that are then disturbed when roots deviate from the vertical as a gravity sensor. However, experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) now allow physical clarity with regard to any assumptions regarding the role of gravity in establishing fundamental root auxin distributions. We examined the spaceflight green fluorescent protein (GFP)-reporter gene expression in roots of transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana : pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, pSCR::SCR–GFP to monitor auxin and pARR5::GFP to monitor cytokinin. Plants on the ISS were imaged live with the Light Microscopy Module (LMM), and compared with control plants imaged on the ground. Preserved spaceflight and ground control plants were examined post flight with confocal microscopy. Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically “vertical” distribution of auxin in the primary root. This confirms that the establishment of the auxin-gradient system, the primary guide for gravity signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between spaceflight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceflight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related. The distribution of auxin in the gravity-sensing portion of the root is not dependent on gravity.

Skewing in Arabidopsis roots involves disparate environmental signaling pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5286820/,"Background Skewing root patterns provide key insights into root growth strategies and mechanisms that produce root architectures. Roots exhibit skewing and waving when grown on a tilted, impenetrable surface. The genetics guiding these morphologies have been examined, revealing that some Arabidopsis ecotypes skew and wave (e.g. WS), while others skew insignificantly but still wave (e.g. Col-0). The underlying molecular mechanisms of skewing and waving remain unclear. In this study, transcriptome data were derived from two Arabidopsis ecotypes, WS and Col-0, under three tilted growth conditions in order to identify candidate genes involved in skewing. Results This work identifies a number of genes that are likely involved in skewing, using growth conditions that differentially affect skewing and waving. Comparing the gene expression profiles of WS and Col-0 in different tilted growth conditions identified 11 candidate genes as potentially involved in the control of skewing. These 11 genes are involved in several different cellular processes, including sugar transport, salt signaling, cell wall organization, and hormone signaling. Conclusions This study identified 11 genes whose change in expression level is associated with root skewing behavior. These genes are involved in signaling and perception, rather than the physical restructuring of root. Future work is needed to elucidate the potential role of these candidate genes during root skewing.

Genetic dissection of the Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptome: Are some responses dispensable for the physiological adaptation of plants to spaceflight?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491145/,"Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.",experimentation international space station reached stage repeated nuanced transcriptome studies beginning illuminate structural metabolic differences plants grown space compared plants earth genes important establishing spaceflight responses identified roles spaceflight physiological adaptation increasingly understood fact different genotypes adapt differently recognized however basic question whether spaceflight responses actually required survival yet posed fundamental notion spaceflight responses may nonadaptive yet explored therefore experiments presented designed ask portions plant spaceflight response genetically removed without causing loss spaceflight survival without causing increased stress responses cara experiment compared spaceflight transcriptome responses root tips two arabidopsis ecotypes col well phyd mutant col grown ambient light iss phyd plants displayed significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared col suggesting altering activity single gene actually improve spaceflight adaptation reducing transcriptome cost physiological adaptation genotype showed even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response ambient light iss broadly indicating plant genotype manipulated reduce cost spaceflight adaptation measured transcriptional response differential genotypic responses suggest genetic manipulation could reduce perhaps eliminate metabolic cost spaceflight adaptation plants germinated left dark iss genotype actually mounted larger transcriptome response col suggesting inspace light environment affects physiological adaptation implies manipulating local habitat also substantially impact metabolic cost spaceflight adaptation

Obtaining root apex transcriptomes is therefore challenging when the samples are limited. The feasibility of using tiny root sections for transcriptome analysis was examined, comparing RNA sequencing (RNA‐Seq) to microarrays in characterizing genes that are relevant to spaceflight. Methods Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype (Col‐0) roots were sectioned into Zone 1 (0.5 mm; root cap and meristematic zone) and Zone 2 (1.5 mm; transition, elongation, and growth‐terminating zone). Differential gene expression in each was compared. Results Both microarrays and RNA‐Seq proved applicable to the small samples. A total of 4180 genes were differentially expressed (with fold changes of 2 or greater) between Zone 1 and Zone 2. In addition, 771 unique genes and 19 novel transcriptionally active regions were identified by RNA‐Seq that were not detected in microarrays. However, microarrays detected spaceflight‐relevant genes that were missed in RNA‐Seq. Discussion Single root tip subsections can be used for transcriptome analysis using either RNA‐Seq or microarrays. Both RNA‐Seq and microarrays provided novel information.

The Plant Health Monitoring System of the EDEN ISS Space Greenhouse in Antarctica during the 2018 experiment phase,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7264257/,"The EDEN ISS greenhouse is a space-analog test facility near the German Neumayer III station in Antarctica. The facility is part of the project of the same name and was designed and built starting from March 2015 and eventually deployed in Antarctica in January 2018. The nominal operation of the greenhouse started on February 7th and continued until the 20th of November. The purpose of the facility is to enable multidisciplinary research on topics related to future plant cultivation on human space exploration missions. Research on food quality and safety, plant health monitoring, microbiology, system validation, human factors and horticultural sciences was conducted. Part of the latter is the determination of the biomass production of the different crops. The data on this topic is presented in this paper. During the first season 26 different crops were grown on the 12.5 m 2 cultivation area of the greenhouse. A large number of crops were grown continuously throughout the 9 months of operation, but there were also crops that were only grown a few times for test purposes. The focus of this season was on growing lettuce, leafy greens and fresh vegetables. In total more than 268 kg of edible biomass was produced by the EDEN ISS greenhouse facility in 2018. Most of the harvest was cucumbers (67 kg), lettuces (56 kg), leafy greens (49 kg), and tomatoes (50 kg) complemented with smaller amounts of herbs (12 kg), radish (8 kg), and kohlrabi (19 kg). The environmental set points for the crops were 330–600 μmol/(m 2* s) LED light, 21°C, ∼65% relative humidity, 1000 ppm and the photoperiod was 17 h per day.

Root skewing-associated genes impact the spaceflight response of Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7064724/,"The observation that plant roots skew in microgravity recently refuted the long-held conviction that skewing was a gravity-dependent phenomenon. Further, spaceflight root skewing suggests that specific root morphologies and cell wall remodeling systems may be important aspects of spaceflight physiological adaptation. However, connections between skewing, cell wall modification and spaceflight physiology are currently based on inferences rather than direct tests. Therefore, the Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 (APEX-03-2) spaceflight study was designed to elucidate the contribution of two skewing- and cell wall-associated genes in Arabidopsis to root behavior and gene expression patterns in spaceflight, to assess whether interruptions of different skewing pathways affect the overall spaceflight-associated process. SPIRAL1 is a skewing-related protein implicated in directional cell expansion, and functions by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. SKU5 is skewing-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of the plasma membrane and cell wall implicated in stress response signaling. These two genes function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, and enable a test of the relevance of skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. In this study, both sku5 and spr1 mutants showed different skewing behavior and markedly different patterns of gene expression in the spaceflight environment. The spr1 mutant showed fewer differentially expressed genes than its Col-0 wild-type, whereas sku5 showed considerably more than its WS wild-type. Developmental age played a substantial role in spaceflight acclimation in all genotypes, but particularly in sku5 plants, where spaceflight 4d seedlings had almost 10-times as many highly differentially expressed genes as the 8d seedlings. These differences demonstrated that the two skewing pathways represented by SKU5 and SPR1 have unique and opposite contributions to physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The spr1 response is less intense than wild type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts spaceflight adaptation. Conversely, the intensity of the sku5 responses suggests that the loss of SKU5 initiates a much more complex, deeper and more stress related response to spaceflight. This suggests that proper SKU5 function is important to spaceflight adaptation.

Articular cartilage and sternal fibrocartilage respond differently to extended microgravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6379395/,"The effects of spaceflight on cartilaginous structure are largely unknown. To address this deficiency, articular cartilage (AC) and sternal cartilage (SC) from mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity on the BION-M1 craft were investigated for pathological changes. The flight AC showed some evidence of degradation at the tissue level with loss of proteoglycan staining and a reduction in mRNA expression of mechano-responsive and structural cartilage matrix proteins compared to non-flight controls. These data suggest that degradative changes are underway in the AC extracellular matrix exposed to microgravity. In contrast, there was no evidence of cartilage breakdown in SC flight samples and the gene expression profile was distinct from that of AC with a reduction in metalloproteinase gene transcription. Since the two cartilages respond differently to microgravity we propose that each is tuned to the biomechanical environments in which they are normally maintained. That is, the differences between magnitude of normal terrestrial loading and the unloading of microgravity dictates the tissue response. Weight-bearing articular cartilage, but not minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage, is negatively affected by the unloading of microgravity. We speculate that the maintenance of physiological loading on AC during spaceflight will minimize AC damage.",effects spaceflight cartilaginous structure largely unknown address deficiency articular cartilage sternal cartilage mice exposed days microgravity bionm craft investigated pathological changes flight showed evidence degradation tissue level loss proteoglycan staining reduction mrna expression mechanoresponsive structural cartilage matrix proteins compared nonflight controls data suggest degradative changes underway extracellular matrix exposed microgravity contrast evidence cartilage breakdown flight samples gene expression profile distinct reduction metalloproteinase gene transcription since two cartilages respond differently microgravity propose tuned biomechanical environments normally maintained differences magnitude normal terrestrial loading unloading microgravity dictates tissue response weightbearing articular cartilage minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage negatively affected unloading microgravity speculate maintenance physiological loading spaceflight minimize damage
Host-microbe interactions in microgravity: assessment and implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4187166/,"Spaceflight imposes several unique stresses on biological life that together can have a profound impact on the homeostasis between eukaryotes and their associated microbes. One such stressor, microgravity, has been shown to alter host-microbe interactions at the genetic and physiological levels. Recent sequencing of the microbiomes associated with plants and animals have shown that these interactions are essential for maintaining host health through the regulation of several metabolic and immune responses. Disruptions to various environmental parameters or community characteristics may impact the resiliency of the microbiome, thus potentially driving host-microbe associations towards disease. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of host-microbe interactions in microgravity and assess the impact of this unique environmental stress on the normal physiological and genetic responses of both pathogenic and mutualistic associations. As humans move beyond our biosphere and undergo longer duration space flights, it will be essential to more fully understand microbial fitness in microgravity conditions in order to maintain a healthy homeostasis between humans, plants and their respective microbiomes.

Environmental cues and symbiont microbe-associated molecular patterns function in concert to drive the daily remodelling of the crypt-cell brush border of the Euprymna scolopes light organ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5219934/,"Summary Recent research has shown that the microbiota affects the biology of associated host epithelial tissues, including their circadian rhythms, although few data are available on how such influences shape the microarchitecture of the brush border. The squid-vibrio system exhibits two modifications of the brush border that supports the symbionts: effacement and repolarization. Together these occur on a daily rhythm in adult animals, at the dawn expulsion of symbionts into the environment, and symbiont colonization of the juvenile host induces an increase in microvillar density. Here we sought to define how these processes are related and the roles of both symbiont colonization and environmental cues. Ultrastructural analyses showed that the juvenile-organ brush borders also efface concomitantly with daily dawn-cued expulsion of symbionts. Manipulation of the environmental light cue and juvenile symbiotic state demonstrated that this behaviour requires the light cue, but not colonization. In contrast, symbionts were required for the observed increase in microvillar density that accompanies post dawn brush-border repolarization; this increase was induced solely by host exposure to phosphorylated lipid A of symbiont cells. These data demonstrate that a partnering of environmental and symbiont cues shapes the brush border and that microbe-associated molecular patterns play a role in the regulation of brush-border microarchitecture.",summary recent research shown microbiota affects biology associated host epithelial tissues including circadian rhythms although data available influences shape microarchitecture brush border squidvibrio system exhibits two modifications brush border supports symbionts effacement repolarization together occur daily rhythm adult animals dawn expulsion symbionts environment symbiont colonization juvenile host induces increase microvillar density sought define processes related roles symbiont colonization environmental cues ultrastructural analyses showed juvenileorgan brush borders also efface concomitantly daily dawncued expulsion symbionts manipulation environmental light cue juvenile symbiotic state demonstrated behaviour requires light cue colonization contrast symbionts required observed increase microvillar density accompanies post dawn brushborder repolarization increase induced solely host exposure phosphorylated lipid symbiont cells data demonstrate partnering environmental symbiont cues shapes brush border microbeassociated molecular patterns play role regulation brushborder microarchitecture

The LO evolved through subfunctionalization of genes expressed in the eye, indicating a deep evolutionary link between these organs.

Modeled microgravity alters lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane vesicle production of the beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7940393/,"Reduced gravity, or microgravity, can have a pronounced impact on the physiology of animals, but the effects on their associated microbiomes are not well understood. Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri was examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. LPS from V. fischeri is known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to flagellar motility. Mutants of V. fischeri defective in the production and rotation of their flagella show significant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. Modeled microgravity also appears to affect the outer-membrane integrity of V. fischeri , as cells incubated under modeled microgravity conditions are more susceptible to cell-membrane-disrupting agents. These results suggest that, like their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be altered under microgravity-like conditions, which may have important implications for host health during spaceflight.

Emergence of novel cephalopod gene regulation and expression through large-scale genome reorganization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9023564/,"Coleoid cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, octopus) have the largest nervous system among invertebrates that together with many lineage-specific morphological traits enables complex behaviors. The genomic basis underlying these innovations remains unknown. Using comparative and functional genomics in the model squid Euprymna scolopes , we reveal the unique genomic, topological, and regulatory organization of cephalopod genomes. We show that coleoid cephalopod genomes have been extensively restructured compared to other animals, leading to the emergence of hundreds of tightly linked and evolutionary unique gene clusters (microsyntenies). Such novel microsyntenies correspond to topological compartments with a distinct regulatory structure and contribute to complex expression patterns. In particular, we identify a set of microsyntenies associated with cephalopod innovations (MACIs) broadly enriched in cephalopod nervous system expression. We posit that the emergence of MACIs was instrumental to cephalopod nervous system evolution and propose that microsyntenic profiling will be central to understanding cephalopod innovations.

Modeled microgravity alters apoptotic gene expression and caspase activity in the squid-vibrio symbiosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9389742/,"Background Spaceflight is a novel and profoundly stressful environment for life. One aspect of spaceflight, microgravity, has been shown to perturb animal physiology thereby posing numerous health risks, including dysregulation of normal developmental pathways. Microgravity can also negatively impact the interactions between animals and their microbiomes. However, the effects of microgravity on developmental processes influenced by beneficial microbes, such as apoptosis, remains poorly understood. Here, the binary mutualism between the bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and the gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, was studied under modeled microgravity conditions to elucidate how this unique stressor alters apoptotic cell death induced by beneficial microbes. Results Analysis of the host genome and transcriptome revealed a complex network of apoptosis genes affiliated with extrinsic/receptor-mediated and intrinsic/stress-induced apoptosis. Expression of apoptosis genes under modeled microgravity conditions occurred earlier and at high levels compared to gravity controls, in particular the expression of genes encoding initiator and executioner caspases. Functional assays of these apoptotic proteases revealed heightened activity under modeled microgravity; however, these increases could be mitigated using caspase inhibitors. Conclusions The outcomes of this study indicated that modeled microgravity alters the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression and that this process is mediated in part by caspases. Modeled microgravity-associated increases of caspase activity can be pharmacologically inhibited suggesting that perturbations to the normal apoptosis signaling cascade can be mitigated, which may have broader implications for maintaining animal-microbial homeostasis in spaceflight.

In vitro generation of mechanically functional cartilage grafts based on adult human stem cells and 3D-woven poly(epsilon-caprolactone) scaffolds,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2824534/,"Three-dimensionally woven poly(ε-caprolactone)(PCL) scaffolds were combined with adult human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) to engineer mechanically functional cartilage constructs in vitro . The specific objectives were to: (i) produce PCL scaffolds with cartilage-like mechanical properties, (ii) demonstrate that hMSCs formed cartilage after 21-days of culture on PCL scaffolds, and (iii) study effects of scaffold structure (loosely vs. tightly woven), culture vessel (static dish vs. oscillating bioreactor), and medium composition (chondrogenic additives with or without serum). Aggregate moduli of 21-day constructs approached normal articular cartilage for tightly woven PCL cultured in bioreactors, were lower for tightly woven PCL cultured statically, and lowest for loosely woven PCL cultured statically ( p <0.05). Construct DNA, total collagen, and glyocosaminoglycans (GAG) increased in a manner dependent on time, culture vessel, and medium composition. Chondrogenesis was verified histologically by rounded cells within a hyaline-like matrix that immunostained for collagen type II but not type I. Bioreactors yielded constructs with higher collagen content ( p <0.05) and more homogenous matrix than static controls.

Chondrogenesis and mineralization during in vitro culture of human mesenchymal stem cells on three-dimensional woven scaffolds,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2991213/,"Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and three-dimensional (3D) woven poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds are promising tools for skeletal tissue engineering. We hypothesized that in vitro culture duration and medium additives can individually and interactively influence the structure, composition, mechanical, and molecular properties of engineered tissues based on hMSCs and 3D poly(ɛ-caprolactone). Bone marrow hMSCs were suspended in collagen gel, seeded on scaffolds, and cultured for 1, 21, or 45 days under chondrogenic and/or osteogenic conditions. Structure, composition, biomechanics, and gene expression were analyzed. In chondrogenic medium, cartilaginous tissue formed by day 21, and hypertrophic mineralization was observed in the newly formed extracellular matrix at the interface with underlying scaffold by day 45. Glycosaminoglycan, hydroxyproline, and calcium contents, and alkaline phosphatase activity depended on culture duration and medium additives, with significant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001). The 45-day constructs exhibited mechanical properties on the order of magnitude of native articular cartilage (aggregate, Young's, and shear moduli of 0.15, 0.12, and 0.033 MPa, respectively). Gene expression was characteristic of chondrogenesis and endochondral bone formation, with sequential regulation of Sox-9, collagen type II, aggrecan, core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfα1)/Runx2, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein-2, and osteocalcin. In contrast, osteogenic medium produced limited osteogenesis.

Asparagine biosynthesis as a mechanism of increased host lethality induced by Serratia marcescens in simulated microgravity environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9111996/,"While studies have shown an increase in pathogenicity in several microbes during spaceflight and after exposure to simulated microgravity, the mechanisms underlying these changes in phenotype are not understood across different pathogens, particularly in opportunistic pathogens. This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium, Serratia marcescens, in simulated microgravity. Low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity as experienced in spaceflight. Our previous findings showed that there was a significant increase in mortality rates of the Drosophila melanogaster host when infected with either spaceflight or LSMMG treated S. marcescens . Here, we report that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in S. marcescens and that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone is not sufficient to contribute to maximal host lethality, since the addition of aspartate to minimal media caused an LSMMG-specific increase in bacterial growth rate that is comparable to that induced by the combination of aspartate and glutamine, but this increase in growth does not cause an equivalent rate of host mortality. However, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine cause both an increase in host mortality and an overexpression of asparagine pathway genes in a LSMMG-dependent manner. We also report that L-asparaginase-mediated breakdown of asparagine is an effective countermeasure for the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates of a model host infected with microgravity-treated S. marcescens and provides a potential mitigation strategy.

Comparative genomic analysis of Cohnella hashimotonis sp. nov. isolated from the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10308117/,"A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella , designated as F6_2S_P_1 T . The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1 T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli , which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1 T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli . Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1 T are anteiso-C 15:0 (51.7%), iso-C 16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C 15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis , with the type strain F6_2S_P_1 T (=NRRL B-65657 T and DSMZ 115098 T ).

Characterization of metagenome-assembled genomes from the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10233975/,"Background Several investigations on the microbial diversity and functional properties of the International Space Station (ISS) environment were carried out to understand the influence of spaceflight conditions on the microbial population. However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of ISS samples are yet to be generated and subjected to various genomic analyses, including phylogenetic affiliation, predicted functional pathways, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence characteristics. Results In total, 46 MAGs were assembled from 21 ISS environmental metagenomes, in which metaSPAdes yielded 20 MAGs and metaWRAP generated 26 MAGs. Among 46 MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus/species combination ( Kalamiella piersonii ) and one novel bacterial species ( Methylobacterium ajmalii ). In addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; this is the first-time fungal genomes were assembled from ISS metagenomes. Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species showed ISS-specific evolution. The genes pertaining to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were enriched. Variations in the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 2 microorganisms in space. Since microbial virulence increases in microgravity, AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of respective ISS isolates and corresponding type strains. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the Enterobacter bugandensis MAG, which has been predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure. Conclusions Comparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity. The Pantoea / Kalamiella strains have the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphisms found within the ISS strains examined. This may suggest that Pantoea / Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. The reconstructed genomes will enable researchers to study the evolution of genomes under microgravity and low-dose irradiation compared to the evolution of microbes here on Earth.

Biocontrol in built environments to reduce pathogen exposure and infection risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10848226/,"The microbiome of the built environment comprises bacterial, archaeal, fungal, and viral communities associated with human-made structures. Even though most of these microbes are benign, antibiotic-resistant pathogens can colonize and emerge indoors, creating infection risk through surface transmission or inhalation. Several studies have catalogued the microbial composition and ecology in different built environment types. These have informed in vitro studies that seek to replicate the physicochemical features that promote pathogenic survival and transmission, ultimately facilitating the development and validation of intervention techniques used to reduce pathogen accumulation. Such interventions include using Bacillus -based cleaning products on surfaces or integrating bacilli into printable materials. Though this work is in its infancy, early research suggests the potential to use microbial biocontrol to reduce hospital- and home-acquired multidrug-resistant infections. Although these techniques hold promise, there is an urgent need to better understand the microbial ecology of built environments and to determine how these biocontrol solutions alter species interactions.

Release of ADP from root epidermis would trigger ionotropic receptor-like activity in the plasma membrane, resulting in transient elevation of cytosolic free calcium. Root epidermal protoplasts (expressing aequorin as a cytosolic free calcium reporter) can support an extracellular ADP-induced cytosolic calcium elevation in the presence of an extracellular reductant.

Real-time In Vivo Recording of Arabidopsis Calcium Signals During Insect Feeding Using a Fluorescent Biosensor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5614317/,"Calcium ions are predicted to be key signaling entities during biotic interactions, with calcium signaling forming an established part of the plant defense response to microbial elicitors and to wounding caused by chewing insects, eliciting systemic calcium signals in plants. However, the role of calcium in vivo during biotic stress is still unclear. This protocol describes the use of a genetically-encoded calcium sensor to detect calcium signals in plants during feeding by a hemipteran pest. Hemipterans such as aphids pierce a small number of cells with specialized, elongated sucking mouthparts, making them the ideal tool to study calcium dynamics when a plant is faced with a biotic stress, which is distinct from a wounding response. In addition, fluorescent biosensors are revolutionizing the measurement of signaling molecules in vivo in both animals and plants. Expressing a GFP-based calcium biosensor, GCaMP3, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the real-time imaging of plant calcium dynamics during insect feeding, with a high spatial and temporal resolution. A repeatable and robust assay has been developed using the fluorescence microscopy of detached GCaMP3 leaves, allowing for the continuous measurement of cytosolic calcium dynamics before, during, and after insect feeding. This reveals a highly-localized rapid calcium elevation around the aphid feeding site that occurs within a few minutes. The protocol can be adapted to other biotic stresses, such as additional insect species, while the use of Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the rapid generation of mutants to facilitate the molecular analysis of the phenomenon.

"Orchestrating rapid long-distance signaling in plants with Ca2+ , ROS, and electrical signals",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5677518/,"SUMMARY Plants show a rapid systemic response to a wide range of environmental stresses, where the signals from the site of stimulus perception are transmitted to distal organs to elicit plant-wide responses. A wide range of signaling molecules are trafficked through the plant, but a trio of potentially interacting messengers, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca 2+ and electrical signaling (‘trio signaling’) appear to form a network supporting rapid signal transmission. The molecular components underlying this rapid communication are beginning to be identified, such as the ROS producing NAPDH oxidase RBOHD, the ion channel two pore channel 1 (TPC1), and glutamate receptor-like channels GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. The plant cell wall presents a plant-specific route for possible propagation of signals from cell to cell. However, the degree to which the cell wall limits information exchange between cells via transfer of small molecules through an extracellular route, or whether it provides an environment to facilitate transmission of regulators such as ROS or H + remains to be determined. Similarly, the role of plasmodesmata as both conduits and gatekeepers for the propagation of rapid cell-to-cell signaling remains a key open question. Regardless of how signals move from cell to cell, they help prepare distant parts of the plant for impending challenges from specific biotic or abiotic stresses.

Test of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome: A discovery environment to explore multiple plant biology spaceflight experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7076552/,"Recent advances in the routine access to space along with increasing opportunities to perform plant growth experiments on board the International Space Station have led to an ever-increasing body of transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data from plants experiencing spaceflight. These datasets hold great promise to help understand how plant biology reacts to this unique environment. However, analyses that mine across such expanses of data are often complex to implement, being impeded by the sheer number of potential comparisons that are possible. Complexities in how the output of these multiple parallel analyses can be presented to the researcher in an accessible and intuitive form provides further barriers to such research. Recent developments in computational systems biology have led to rapid advances in interactive data visualization environments designed to perform just such tasks. However, to date none of these tools have been tailored to the analysis of the broad-ranging plant biology spaceflight data. We have therefore developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database ( https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast ) to address this gap in our capabilities. TOAST is a relational database that uses the Qlik database management software to link plant biology, spaceflight-related omics datasets, and their associated metadata. This environment helps visualize relationships across multiple levels of experiments in an easy to use gene-centric platform. TOAST draws on data from The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) GeneLab and other data repositories and also connects results to a suite of web-based analytical tools to facilitate further investigation of responses to spaceflight and related stresses. The TOAST graphical user interface allows for quick comparisons between plant spaceflight experiments using real-time, gene-specific queries, or by using functional gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, or other filtering systems to explore genetic networks of interest. Testing of the database shows that TOAST confirms patterns of gene expression already highlighted in the literature, such as revealing the modulation of oxidative stress-related responses across multiple plant spaceflight experiments. However, this data exploration environment can also drive new insights into patterns of spaceflight responsive gene expression. For example, TOAST analyses highlight changes to mitochondrial function as likely shared responses in many plant spaceflight experiments.

Tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps regulate Ca2+ signals during pattern-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7414185/,"Significance Ca 2+ signaling is closely linked to the triggering of plant immune responses. We show that when the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 is used to trigger immune responses in mutants missing tonoplast Ca 2+ pumps, it causes disrupted Ca 2+ signals that are higher in amplitude than expected from wild-type plants. Relocalization of a Ca 2+ pump normally found in the plasma membrane to the tonoplast rescues both the tonoplast pump knockout mutant’s immune-related phenotypes and aberrant Ca 2+ signaling dynamics. These observations support the notion that tonoplast-localized pumps are critical for the proper maintenance of Ca 2+ dynamics in innate immune responses but that any regulatory systems specific to the endogenous tonoplast pumps may not be required to support these signaling events.

The fast and the furious: Rapid long-range signaling in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8133610/,"Plants possess a systemic signaling system whereby local stimuli can lead to rapid, plant-wide responses. In addition to the redistribution of chemical messengers that range from RNAs and peptides to hormones and metabolites, a communication system acting through the transmission of electrical, Ca2+, reactive oxygen species and potentially even hydraulic signals has also been discovered. This latter system can propagate signals across many cells each second and researchers are now beginning to uncover the molecular machineries behind this rapid communications network. Thus, elements such as the reactive oxygen species producing NAPDH oxidases and ion channels of the two pore channel, glutamate receptor-like and cyclic nucleotide gated families are all required for the rapid propagation of these signals. Upon arrival at their distant targets, these changes trigger responses ranging from the production of hormones, to changes in the levels of primary metabolites and shifts in patterns of gene expression. These systemic responses occur within seconds to minutes of perception of the initial, local signal, allowing for the rapid deployment of plant-wide responses. For example, an insect starting to chew on just a single leaf triggers preemptive antiherbivore defenses throughout the plant well before it has a chance to move on to the next leaf on its menu.",plants possess systemic signaling system whereby local stimuli lead rapid plantwide responses addition redistribution chemical messengers range rnas peptides hormones metabolites communication system acting transmission electrical reactive oxygen species potentially even hydraulic signals also discovered latter system propagate signals across many cells second researchers beginning uncover molecular machineries behind rapid communications network thus elements reactive oxygen species producing napdh oxidases ion channels two pore channel glutamate receptorlike cyclic nucleotide gated families required rapid propagation signals upon arrival distant targets changes trigger responses ranging production hormones changes levels primary metabolites shifts patterns gene expression systemic responses occur within seconds minutes perception initial local signal allowing rapid deployment plantwide responses example insect starting chew single leaf triggers preemptive antiherbivore defenses throughout plant well chance move next leaf menu

The vacuolar H+/Ca transporter CAX1 participates in submergence and anoxia stress responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9706465/,"A plant’s oxygen supply can vary from normal (normoxia) to total depletion (anoxia). Tolerance to anoxia is relevant to wetland species, rice ( Oryza sativa ) cultivation, and submergence tolerance of crops. Decoding and transmitting calcium (Ca) signals may be an important component to anoxia tolerance; however, the contribution of intracellular Ca transporters to this process is poorly understood. Four functional ca tion/proton e x changers (CAX1–4) in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) help regulate Ca homeostasis around the vacuole. Our results demonstrate that cax1 mutants are more tolerant to both anoxic conditions and submergence. Using phenotypic measurements, RNA-sequencing, and proteomic approaches, we identified cax1 -mediated anoxia changes that phenocopy changes present in anoxia-tolerant crops: altered metabolic processes, diminished reactive oxygen species production post anoxia, and altered hormone signaling. Comparing wild-type and cax1 expressing genetically encoded Ca indicators demonstrated altered cytosolic Ca signals in cax1 during reoxygenation.

Meta-analysis of the space flight and microgravity response of the Arabidopsis plant transcriptome,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10027818/,"Spaceflight presents a multifaceted environment for plants, combining the effects on growth of many stressors and factors including altered gravity, the influence of experiment hardware, and increased radiation exposure. To help understand the plant response to this complex suite of factors this study compared transcriptomic analysis of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana spaceflight experiments deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s GeneLab data repository. These data were reanalyzed for genes showing significant differential expression in spaceflight versus ground controls using a single common computational pipeline for either the microarray or the RNA-seq datasets. Such a standardized approach to analysis should greatly increase the robustness of comparisons made between datasets. This analysis was coupled with extensive cross-referencing to a curated matrix of metadata associated with these experiments. Our study reveals that factors such as analysis type (i.e., microarray versus RNA-seq) or environmental and hardware conditions have important confounding effects on comparisons seeking to define plant reactions to spaceflight. The metadata matrix allows selection of studies with high similarity scores, i.e., that share multiple elements of experimental design, such as plant age or flight hardware. Comparisons between these studies then helps reduce the complexity in drawing conclusions arising from comparisons made between experiments with very different designs.

Ionizing Radiation Stimulates Expression of Pro-Osteoclastogenic Genes in Marrow and Skeletal Tissue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4490751/,"Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause rapid mineral loss and increase bone-resorbing osteoclasts within metabolically active, cancellous bone tissue leading to structural deficits. To better understand mechanisms involved in rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the influence of total body irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease. Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2 Gy gamma rays ( 137 Cs, 0.8 Gy/min) or heavy ions ( 56 Fe, 600MeV, 0.50–1.1 Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is ≥10 Gy) or accumulates over long-duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue were harvested 4 h—7 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6-fold within 4 h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand ( Rankl ), within marrow cells over controls. Similarly, Rankl expression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron exposure (9.2-fold). Changes in Rankl expression induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls). The ratio, Rankl/Opg , in marrow increased by 1.8-fold, a net pro-resorption balance.

Preservation of Multiple Mammalian Tissues to Maximize Science Return from Ground Based and Spaceflight Experiments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5132293/,"Background Even with recent scientific advancements, challenges posed by limited resources and capabilities at the time of sample dissection continue to limit the collection of high quality tissues from experiments that can be conducted only infrequently and at high cost, such as in space. The resources and time it takes to harvest tissues post-euthanasia, and the methods and duration of long duration storage, potentially have negative impacts on sample quantity and quality, thereby limiting the scientific outcome that can be achieved. Objectives The goals of this study were to optimize methods for both sample recovery and science return from rodent experiments, with possible relevance to both ground based and spaceflight studies. The first objective was to determine the impacts of tissue harvest time post-euthanasia, preservation methods, and storage duration, focusing on RNA quality and enzyme activities in liver and spleen as indices of sample quality. The second objective was to develop methods that will maximize science return by dissecting multiple tissues after long duration storage in situ at -80°C. Methods Tissues of C57Bl/6J mice were dissected and preserved at various time points post-euthanasia and stored at -80°C for up to 11 months. In some experiments, tissues were recovered from frozen carcasses which had been stored at -80°C up to 7 months. RNA quantity and quality was assessed by measuring RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Additionally, the quality of tissues was assessed by measuring activities of hepatic enzymes (catalase, glutathione reductase and GAPDH). Results Fresh tissues were collected up to one hour post-euthanasia, and stored up to 11 months at -80°C, with minimal adverse effects on the RNA quality of either livers or RNAlater-preserved spleens. Liver enzyme activities were similar to those of positive controls, with no significant effect observed at any time point. Tissues dissected from frozen carcasses that had been stored for up to 7 months at -80°C had variable results, depending on the specific tissue analyzed. RNA quality of liver, heart, and kidneys were minimally affected after 6–7 months of storage at -80°C, whereas RNA degradation was evident in tissues such as small intestine, bone, and bone marrow when they were collected from the carcasses frozen for 2.5 months. Conclusion These results demonstrate that 1) the protocols developed for spaceflight experiments with on-orbit dissections support the retrieval of high quality samples for RNA expression and some protein analyses, despite delayed preservation post-euthanasia or prolonged storage, and 2) many additional tissues for gene expression analysis can be obtained by dissection even following prolonged storage of the tissue in situ at -80°C.

Hindlimb Unloading: Rodent Analog for Microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11747068/,"Background Prolonged spaceflight is known to cause vascular deconditioning and remodeling. Tail suspension, a widely used spaceflight analog, is reported to result in vascular remodeling of rats. However, little is known about the cellular atlas of the heterogeneous cells of CA and FA from hindlimb-unloaded rats. Methods Firstly, we leveraged scRNA-seq to perform clustering analysis to identify diverse cell populations and sub-clusters within CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of hindlimb unloading. The dysregulated genes specific for artery types and cell types in HU group compared to Con were unraveled. Then R package “Cellchat” was used to reveal ligand-receptor cellular communication. At last, the TF network analysis was performed using the SCENIC R package to predict the pivotal TFs in rat artery remodeling induced by hindlimb unloading. Results Clustering analysis identified ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, and a spectrum of immune cells, as well as neuronal and stem cells. Notably, an increased percentage of ECs in the CA and a diminished proportion of SMCs in both CA and FA were observed following tail suspension. Intersection of dysregulated genes specific for artery type and cell type after tail suspension revealed several gene sets involved in ECM remodeling, inflammation, vasoconstriction, etc. Fibroblasts, in particular, exhibited the most significant gene expression variability, highlighting their plasticity. Subclustering within ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts revealed specialized subsets engaged in processes such as EndoMT and cell cycle checkpoint regulation. Additionally, enhanced intercellular interactions among major cell types, especially between SMC and fibroblast, underscored the importance of cell communication in vascular remodeling. Several TFs were identified as potentially influential in the vascular remodeling process under simulated microgravity conditions. Conclusions This study presents the first cellular atlas of the conductive arteries in hindlimb-unloaded rats, revealing a spectrum of dysregulated gene profiles. The identification of the subclusters of ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts, cellular communication analysis and transcription factors prediction are also included in this work.

Redox Signaling and Its Impact on Skeletal and Vascular Responses to Spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666834/,"Spaceflight entails exposure to numerous environmental challenges with the potential to contribute to both musculoskeletal and vascular dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to describe current understanding of microgravity and radiation impacts on the mammalian skeleton and associated vasculature at the level of the whole organism. Recent experiments from spaceflight and ground-based models have provided fresh insights into how these environmental stresses influence mechanisms that are related to redox signaling, oxidative stress, and tissue dysfunction. Emerging mechanistic knowledge on cellular defenses to radiation and other environmental stressors, including microgravity, are useful for both screening and developing interventions against spaceflight-induced deficits in bone and vascular function.

Influence of social isolation during prolonged simulated weightlessness by hindlimb unloading,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6753329/,"The hindlimb unloading (HU) model has been used extensively to simulate the cephalad fluid shift and musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight with its application expanding to study immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system responses, among others. Most HU studies are performed with singly housed animals, although social isolation also can substantially impact behavior and physiology, and therefore may confound HU experimental results. Other HU variants that allow for paired housing have been developed although no systematic assessment has been made to understand the effects of social isolation on HU outcomes. Hence, we aimed to determine the contribution of social isolation to tissue responses to HU. To accomplish this, we developed a refinement to the traditional NASA Ames single housing HU system to accommodate social housing in pairs, retaining desirable features of the original design. We conducted a 30-day HU experiment with adult, female mice that were either singly or socially housed. HU animals in both single and social housing displayed expected musculoskeletal deficits versus housing matched, normally loaded (NL) controls. However, select immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses were differentially impacted by the HU social environment relative to matched NL controls. HU led to a reduction in % CD4 + T cells in singly housed, but not in socially housed mice. Unexpectedly, HU increased adrenal gland mass in socially housed but not singly housed mice, while social isolation increased adrenal gland mass in NL controls. HU also led to elevated plasma corticosterone levels at day 30 in both singly and socially housed mice. Thus, musculoskeletal responses to simulated weightlessness are similar regardless of social environment with a few differences in adrenal and immune responses. Our findings show that combined stressors can mask, not only exacerbate, select responses to HU. These findings further expand the utility of the HU model for studying possible combined effects of spaceflight stressors.

Validation of a new Rodent experimental System to investigate consequences of Long Duration Space Habitation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7012842/,"Animal models are useful for exploring the health consequences of prolonged spaceflight. Capabilities were developed to perform experiments in low earth orbit with on-board sample recovery, thereby avoiding complications caused by return to Earth. For NASA’s Rodent Research-1 mission, female mice (ten 32 wk C57BL/6NTac; ten 16 wk C57BL/6J) were launched on an unmanned vehicle, then resided on the International Space Station for 21/22d or 37d in microgravity. Mice were euthanized on-orbit, livers and spleens dissected, and remaining tissues frozen in situ for later analyses. Mice appeared healthy by daily video health checks and body, adrenal, and spleen weights of 37d-flight (FLT) mice did not differ from ground controls housed in flight hardware (GC), while thymus weights were 35% greater in FLT than GC. Mice exposed to 37d of spaceflight displayed elevated liver mass (33%) and select enzyme activities compared to GC, whereas 21/22d-FLT mice did not. FLT mice appeared more physically active than respective GC while soleus muscle showed expected atrophy. RNA and enzyme activity levels in tissues recovered on-orbit were of acceptable quality. Thus, this system establishes a new capability for conducting long-duration experiments in space, enables sample recovery on-orbit, and avoids triggering standard indices of chronic stress.

Skeletal tissue regulation by catalase over-expression in mitochondria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4405755/,"The mechanisms triggering disuse muscle atrophy remain of debate. It is becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways controlling muscle mass. We have recently shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in disuse atrophy of soleus, a slow, oxidative muscle. Here we tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading-induced atrophy could be due to mitochondrial dysfunction in fast muscles too, notwithstanding their much lower mitochondrial content. Gastrocnemius displayed atrophy following both 3 and 7 days of unloading. SOD1 and catalase up-regulation, no H 2 O 2 accumulation and no increase of protein carbonylation suggest the antioxidant defence system efficiently reacted to redox imbalance in the early phases of disuse. A defective mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1 down-regulation) occurred together with an impairment of OXPHOS capacity. Furthermore, at 3 days of unloading higher acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation was found, suggesting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activation. To test the role of mitochondrial alterations we used Tg-mice overexpressing PGC-1α because of the known effect of PGC-1α on stimulation of Mfn2 expression. PGC-α overexpression was sufficient to prevent (i) the decrease of pro-fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1), (ii) activation of the AMPK pathway, (iii) the inducible expression of MuRF1 and atrogin1 and of authopagic factors, and (iv) any muscle mass loss in response to disuse. As the effects of increased PGC-1α activity were sustained throughout disuse, compounds inducing PGC-1α expression could be useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy also in fast muscles.",mechanisms triggering disuse muscle atrophy remain debate becoming evident mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways controlling muscle mass recently shown mitochondrial dysfunction plays major role disuse atrophy soleus slow oxidative muscle tested hypothesis hindlimb unloadinginduced atrophy could due mitochondrial dysfunction fast muscles notwithstanding much lower mitochondrial content gastrocnemius displayed atrophy following days unloading sod catalase upregulation accumulation increase protein carbonylation suggest antioxidant defence system efficiently reacted redox imbalance early phases disuse defective mitochondrial fusion mfn mfn opa downregulation occurred together impairment oxphos capacity furthermore days unloading higher acetylcoa carboxylase acc phosphorylation found suggesting ampactivated protein kinase ampk pathway activation test role mitochondrial alterations used tgmice overexpressing pgc known effect pgc stimulation mfn expression pgc overexpression sufficient prevent decrease profusion proteins mfn mfn opa activation ampk pathway iii inducible expression murf atrogin authopagic factors muscle mass loss response disuse effects increased pgc activity sustained throughout disuse compounds inducing pgc expression could useful treat prevent muscle atrophy also fast muscles
Overexpression of catalase in mitochondria mitigates changes in hippocampal cytokine expression following simulated microgravity and isolation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8260663/,"Isolation on Earth can alter physiology and signaling of organs systems, including the central nervous system. Although not in complete solitude, astronauts operate in an isolated environment during spaceflight. In this study, we determined the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity solely or combined, on the inflammatory cytokine milieu of the hippocampus. Adult female wild-type mice underwent simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading for 30 days in single or social (paired) housing. In hippocampus, simulated microgravity and isolation each regulate a discrete repertoire of cytokines associated with inflammation. Their combined effects are not additive. A model for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching via targeted overexpression of the human catalase gene to the mitochondria (MCAT mice), are protected from isolation- and/or simulated microgravity-induced changes in cytokine expression.

An extensive allelic series of Drosophila kae1 mutants reveals diverse and tissue-specific requirements for t6A biogenesis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647464/,"N 6 -threonylcarbamoyl-adenosine (t6A) is one of the few RNA modifications that is universally present in life. This modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon–codon interactions. Nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have focused on single-celled organisms. In this study, we report the isolation of an extensive allelic series in the Drosophila ortholog of the core t6A biosynthesis factor Kae1. kae1 hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Nevertheless, complementation of Drosophila Kae1 and other t6A factors in corresponding yeast null mutants demonstrates that these metazoan genes execute t6A synthesis. Turning to the biological consequences of t6A loss, we characterize prominent kae1 melanotic masses and show that they are associated with lymph gland overgrowth and ectopic generation of lamellocytes. On the other hand, kae1 mutants exhibit other phenotypes that reflect insufficient tissue growth. Interestingly, whole-tissue and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs are exquisitely sensitive to loss of kae1 , whereas nonproliferating tissues are less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many tissues, certain strong kae1 alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size during their extended larval phase. Our studies highlight tissue-specific requirements of the t6A pathway in a metazoan context and provide insights into the diverse biological roles of this fundamental RNA modification during animal development and disease.

Novel Organelles with Elements of Bacterial and Eukaryotic Secretion Systems Weaponize Parasites of Drosophila,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5659752/,"SUMMARY The evolutionary success of parasitoid wasps, a highly diverse group of
insects widely used in biocontrol, depends on a variety of life history
strategies in conflict with those of their hosts [ 1 ]. Drosophila melanogaster is a natural host of parasitic wasps of the genus Leptopilina .
Attack by L. boulardi ( Lb ), a specialist wasp
to flies of the melanogaster group, activates NF-κB-mediated humoral and
cellular immunity. Inflammatory blood cells mobilize and encapsulate Lb eggs and embryos [ 2 – 5 ]. L. heterotoma ( Lh ), a generalist wasp,
kills larval blood cells and actively suppresses immune responses. Spiked
virus-like particles (VLPs) in wasp venom have clearly been linked to its
successful parasitism of Drosophila [ 6 ], but VLP composition and their biotic
nature have remained mysterious. Our proteomics studies reveal that VLPs lack
viral coat proteins but possess a pharmacopoeia of (a) eukaryotic vesicular
transport system, (b) immunity, and (c) previously unknown proteins. These novel
proteins distinguish Lh from Lb VLPs; notably,
some proteins specific to Lh VLPs possess sequence similarities
with bacterial secretion system proteins. Structure-informed analyses of an
abundant Lh VLP surface/spike-tip protein, p40, reveal
similarities to the needle-tip invasin proteins SipD/IpaD of Gram negative
bacterial type 3 secretion systems that breach immune barriers and deliver
virulence factors into mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that Lh VLPs represent a new class of extracellular organelles
and share pathways for protein delivery with both eukaryotic microvesicles and
bacterial surface secretion systems. Given their mixed prokaryotic/eukaryotic
properties, we propose the term Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles (MSEVs) to
replace VLP.

A combined computational strategy of sequence and structural analysis predicts the existence of a functional eicosanoid pathway in Drosophila melanogaster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6372189/,"This study reports on a putative eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway in Drosophila melanogaster and challenges the currently held view that mechanistic routes to synthesize eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipids do not exist in insects, since to date, putative fly homologs of most mammalian enzymes have not been identified. Here we use systematic and comprehensive bioinformatics approaches to identify most of the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Sensitive sequence analysis techniques identified candidate Drosophila enzymes that share low global sequence identities with their human counterparts. Twenty Drosophila candidates were selected based upon (a) sequence identity with human enzymes of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, (b) similar domain architecture and structural conservation of the catalytic domain, and (c) presence of potentially equivalent functional residues. Evaluation of full-length structural models for these 20 top-scoring Drosophila candidates revealed a surprising degree of conservation in their overall folds and potential analogs for functional residues in all 20 enzymes. Although we were unable to identify any suitable candidate for lipoxygenase enzymes, we report structural homology models of three fly cyclooxygenases. Our findings predict that the D . melanogaster genome likely codes for one or more pathways for eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipid synthesis. Our study suggests that classical and/or novel eicosanoids mediators must regulate biological functions in insects–predictions that can be tested with the power of Drosophila genetics.

Immune suppressive extracellular vesicle proteins of Leptopilina heterotoma are encoded in the wasp genome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6945029/,"Leptopilina heterotoma are obligate parasitoid wasps that develop in the body of their Drosophila hosts. During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts’ body cavity. The venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. heterotoma MSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we identified 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these structures. Sequences for more than 90% of these proteins are present in the whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and de novo assembly of the 460 Mb-sized L. heterotoma genome revealed 90% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts. These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of figitid and related wasp species.

A parasitoid wasp of Drosophila employs preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete its host's blood cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8191917/,"The wasps Leptopilina heterotoma parasitize and ingest their Drosophila hosts. They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success. But how EVs disperse within the host, enter and kill hematopoietic cells is not well understood. Using an antibody marker for L . heterotoma EVs, we show that these parasite-derived structures are readily distributed within the hosts’ hemolymphatic system. EVs converge around the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in Drosophila . The PSC serves as a source of developmental signals in naïve animals. In wasp-infected animals, the PSC directs the differentiation of lymph gland progenitors into lamellocytes. These lamellocytes are needed to encapsulate the wasp egg and block parasite development. We found that L . heterotoma infection disassembles the PSC and PSC cells disperse into the disintegrating lymph gland lobes. Genetically manipulated PSC-less lymph glands remain non-responsive and largely intact in the face of L . heterotoma infection. We also show that the larval lymph gland progenitors use the endocytic machinery to internalize EVs. Once inside, L . heterotoma EVs damage the Rab7- and LAMP-positive late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. Rab5 maintains hematopoietic and immune quiescence as Rab5 knockdown results in hematopoietic over-proliferation and ectopic lamellocyte differentiation. Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., (a) phagocytosis of the wasp’s immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. These results help explain why the lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted for destruction.

In Silico Analysis of a Drosophila Parasitoid Venom Peptide Reveals Prevalence of the Cation‚ÄìPolar‚ÄìCation Clip Motif in Knottin Proteins,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9865768/,"As generalist parasitoid wasps, Leptopilina heterotoma are highly successful on many species of fruit flies of the genus Drosophila . The parasitoids produce specialized multi-strategy extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures in their venom. Proteomic analysis identified several immunity-associated proteins, including the knottin peptide, LhKNOT, containing the structurally conserved inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) fold, which is present in proteins from diverse taxa. Our structural and docking analysis of LhKNOT’s 36-residue core knottin fold revealed that in addition to the knottin motif itself, it also possesses a Cation–Polar–Cation (CPC) clip. The CPC clip motif is thought to facilitate antimicrobial activity in heparin-binding proteins. Surprisingly, a majority of ICKs tested also possess the CPC clip motif, including 75 bona fide plant and arthropod knottin proteins that share high sequence and/or structural similarity with LhKNOT. Like LhKNOT and these other 75 knottin proteins, even the Drosophila Drosomycin antifungal peptide, a canonical target gene of the fly’s Toll-NF-kappa B immune pathway, contains this CPC clip motif. Together, our results suggest a possible defensive function for the parasitoid LhKNOT. The prevalence of the CPC clip motif, intrinsic to the cysteine knot within the knottin proteins examined here, suggests that the resultant 3D topology is important for their biochemical functions. The CPC clip is likely a highly conserved structural motif found in many diverse proteins with reported heparin binding capacity, including amyloid proteins. Knottins are targets for therapeutic drug development, and insights into their structure–function relationships will advance novel drug design.

Drosophila parasitoids go to space: Unexpected effects of spaceflight on hosts and their parasitoids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10797188/,"Summary While fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster ) and humans exhibit immune system dysfunction in space, studies examining their immune systems’ interactions with natural parasites in space are lacking. Drosophila parasitoid wasps modify blood cell function to suppress host immunity. In this study, naive and parasitized ground and space flies from a tumor-free control and a blood tumor-bearing mutant strain were examined. Inflammation-related genes were activated in space in both fly strains. Whereas control flies did not develop tumors, tumor burden increased in the space-returned tumor-bearing mutants. Surprisingly, control flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than mutant flies; many of their essential genes were downregulated. Parasitoids appeared more resilient than fly hosts, and spaceflight did not significantly impact wasp survival or the expression of their virulence genes. Previously undocumented mutant wasps with novel wing color and wing shape were isolated post-flight and will be invaluable for host-parasite studies on Earth.

Simultaneous exposure of cultured human lymphoblastic cells to simulated microgravity and radiation increases chromosome aberrations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7555395/,"During space travel, humans are continuously exposed to two major environmental stresses, microgravity (μ G ) and space radiation. One of the fundamental questions is whether the two stressors are interactive. For over half a century, many studies were carried out in space, as well as using devices that simulated μ G on the ground to investigate gravity effects on cells and organisms, and we have gained insights into how living organisms respond to μ G . However, our knowledge on how to assess and manage human health risks in long-term mission to the Moon or Mars is drastically limited. For example, little information is available on how cells respond to simultaneous exposure to space radiation and μ G . In this study, we analyzed the frequencies of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells exposed to X-ray or carbon ion under the simulated μ G conditions. A higher frequency of both simple and complex types of CA were observed in cells exposed to radiation and μ G simultaneously compared to CA frequency in cells exposed to radiation only. Our study shows that the dose response data on space radiation obtained at the 1 G condition could lead to the underestimation of astronauts’ potential risk for health deterioration, including cancer. This study also emphasizes the importance of obtaining data on the molecular and cellular responses to irradiation under μ G conditions.

We developed robust hardware to screen, in parallel, the complete collection of ~4800 homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains, each carrying unique DNA that acts as strain identifiers. We compared strain fitness for the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections grown in spaceflight and ground, as well as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second additive stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity profiles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a compendium of drugs whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported.

Physical Forces Modulate Oxidative Status and Stress Defense Meditated Metabolic Adaptation of Yeast Colonies: Spaceflight and Microgravity Simulations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6560652/,"Baker’s yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) has broad genetic homology to human cells. Although typically grown as 1-2mm diameter colonies under certain conditions yeast can form very large (10 + mm in diameter) or ‘giant’ colonies on agar. Giant yeast colonies have been used to study diverse biomedical processes such as cell survival, aging, and the response to cancer pharmacogenomics. Such colonies evolve dynamically into complex stratified structures that respond differentially to environmental cues. Ammonia production, gravity driven ammonia convection, and shear defense responses are key differentiation signals for cell death and reactive oxygen system pathways in these colonies. The response to these signals can be modulated by experimental interventions such as agar composition, gene deletion and application of pharmaceuticals. In this study we used physical factors including colony rotation and microgravity to modify ammonia convection and shear stress as environmental cues and observed differences in the responses of both ammonia dependent and stress response dependent pathways We found that the effects of random positioning are distinct from rotation. Furthermore, both true and simulated microgravity exacerbated both cellular redox responses and apoptosis. These changes were largely shear-response dependent but each model had a unique response signature as measured by shear stress genes and the promoter set which regulates them These physical techniques permitted a graded manipulation of both convection and ammonia signaling and are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.

Role of shear stress on renal proximal tubular cells for nephrotoxicity assays,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9146534/,"Increased viscosity of concentrated contrast media (CM) in the renal tubules can perturb renal hemodynamics and have a detrimental effect on tubular epithelial cells. However, the effects of viscosity on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) remain poorly understood. Conventional in vitro culture studies do not reflect the rheological properties of CM. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CM viscosity on renal tubules using a kidney-on-a-chip and two different types of CM. Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) were cultured in a three-dimensional microfluidic culture platform under bidirectional fluid shear stress. We treated the RPTEC with two types of CM: low- (LOCM, iopromide) and iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM, iodixanol). Renal tubular cell injury induced by LOCM and IOCM was examined under different iodine concentrations (50–250 mgI/mL) and shear-stress conditions. LOCM showed a significant dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, which was significantly higher than that of IOCM under static and low-to-moderate shear stress conditions. However, high shear-stress resulted in reduced cell viability in IOCM; no difference between IOCM and LOCM was found under high shear-stress conditions. The cytotoxic effects were pronounced at a mean shear stress of 1 dyn/cm 2 or higher. The high viscosity of IOCM slowed the fluid flow rate and augmented fluid shear-stress. We suggest an alternative in vitro model of CIN using the three-dimensional kidney-on-a-chip. Our results indicate a vital role of viscosity-induced nephrotoxicity under high shear-stress conditions, contrary to the findings of conventional in vitro studies.

Bone hemodynamic responses to changes in external pressure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11492218/,"Importance At present, there is no consensus on the concentration of epinephrine/physiological saline for subcutaneous injection into external auditory canal (EAC) under general anesthesia in otoendoscopic surgery. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) research is needed to provide reference, as this concentration can provide satisfactory surgical field clarity while maintaining patients’ hemodynamic stability. Objective Comparison of the effect of subcutaneous injection of different concentrations of epinephrine/physiological saline into EAC under general anesthesia in otoendoscopic surgery on surgical field clarity and hemodynamics. Design This double-blind, RCT study was about the effect of topical epinephrine injection in otoendoscopic surgery. Setting This study was conducted at a single institution. Participants This study included 168 patients conformed to the inclusion criteria. Intervention Patients were randomized to receive different concentrations of epinephrine/physiological saline injection (1:5000, 1:10,000, 1:20,000, or 1:40,000) into the junction of bone and cartilage at posterior wall of EAC during surgery. Main Outcome Measures Surgical field clarity was assessed with surgical field clarity grading scale and tympanic membrane flap flipping time. Hemodynamic changes were monitored by clinical parameters of blood pressure, heart rate, and ST segment of ECG. Results There were no statistically-significant differences in surgical field clarity grade ( P = .577) and tympanic membrane flap flipping time ( P = .490) among 4 concentration groups. Epinephrine injection did cause an increase in hemodynamic parameters when compared with baseline ( P < .05). Compared with the relatively-lower concentration groups (1:20,000 and 1:40,000), the relatively-higher concentration groups (1:5000 and 1:10,000) had more significant and long-lasting effect until 30 minutes after injection. Conclusions and relevance Four concentration groups of topical epinephrine injection in otoendoscopic surgery have the same effect on surgical field clarity. For the stability of patients’ hemodynamics, we would prefer to recommend the use of concentrations with minimal impact on hemodynamics, ranging from 1:20,000 to 1:40,000.

Back pain in space and post-flight spine injury: Mechanisms and countermeasure development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6339989/,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Prolonged microgravity exposure is associated with localized low back pain and an elevated risk of post-flight disc herniation. Although the mechanisms by which microgravity impairs the spine are unclear, they should be foundational for developing in-flight countermeasures for maintaining astronaut spine health. Because human spine anatomy has adapted to upright posture on Earth, observations of how spaceflight affects the spine should also provide new and potentially important information on spine biomechanics that benefit the general population. PURPOSE: This study compares quantitative measures of lumbar spine anatomy, health, and bio-mechanics in astronauts before and after 6 months of microgravity exposure on board the International Space Station (ISS). STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective longitudinal study. SAMPLE: Six astronaut crewmember volunteers from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with 6-month missions aboard the ISS comprised our study sample. OUTCOME MEASURES: For multifidus and erector spinae at L3–L4, measures include cross-sectional area (CSA), functional cross-sectional area (FCSA), and FCSA/CSA. Other measures include supine lumbar lordosis (L1–S1), active (standing) and passive (lying) flexion-extension range of motion (FE ROM) for each lumbar disc segment, disc water content from T2-weighted intensity, Pfirrmann grade, vertebral end plate pathology, and subject-reported incidence of chronic low back pain or disc injuries at 1-year follow-up. METHODS: 3T magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic fluoroscopy of the lumbar spine were collected for each subject at two time points: approximately 30 days before launch (pre-flight) and 1 day following 6 months spaceflight on the ISS (post-flight). Outcome measures were compared between time points using paired t tests and regression analyses. RESULTS: Supine lumbar lordosis decreased (flattened) by an average of 11% (p=.019). Active FE ROM decreased for the middle three lumbar discs (L2–L3: −22.1%, p=.049; L3–L4: −17.3%, p=.016; L4–L5: −30.3%, p=.004). By contrast, no significant passive FE ROM changes in these discs were observed (p>.05). Disc water content did not differ systematically from pre- to post-flight. Multifidus and erector spinae changed variably between subjects, with five of six subjects experiencing an average decrease 20% for FCSA and 8%–9% for CSA in both muscles. For all subjects, changes in multifidus FCSA strongly correlated with changes in lordosis (r 2 =0.86, p=.008) and active FE ROM at L4–L5 (r 2 =0.94, p=.007). Additionally, changes in multifidus FCSA/CSA correlated with changes in lordosis (r 2 =0.69, p=.03). Although multifidus-associated changes in lordosis and ROM were present among all subjects, only those with severe, pre-flight end plate irregularities (two of six subjects) had post-flight lumbar symptoms (including chronic low back pain or disc herniation). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that multifidus atrophy, rather than intervertebral disc swelling, associated strongly with lumbar flattening and increased stiffness. Because these changes have been previously linked with detrimental spine biomechanics and pain in terrestrial populations, when combined with evidence of pre-flight vertebral end plate insufficiency, they may elevate injury risk for astronauts upon return to gravity loading. Our results also have implications for deconditioned spines on Earth. We anticipate that our results will inform new astronaut countermeasures that target the multifidus muscles, and research on the role of muscular stability in relation to chronic low back pain and disc injury. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Fifteen days of microgravity causes growth in calvaria of mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4110898/,"Bone remodeling may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 mice calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the space flight (SF) group compared to the ground control (GC) group – the mean ± SD for SF group was 10.48 ± 0.47 %, compared to 9.64 ± 0.79 % for GC group (p<0.05). CsTh demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099 ±0.006 mm in the GC group to 0.104 ±0.005 mm in the SF group (p=0.12). TMD was similar between the two groups with 0.878 ±0.029 g/cc for GC and 0.893 ± 0.028 g/cc for SF (p=0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes adaptive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight.

Altered disc compression in children with idiopathic low back pain: an upright magnetic resonance imaging backpack study,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3947616/,"Study Design This study is a repeated measures design to measure the lumbar spine’s response to common backpack loads in children with idiopathic low back pain (ILBP) using upright MRI. Objective The purpose of this study is to analyze the lumbar spine’s response to backpack loads with upright MRI in ILBP children in order to compare their results to previously published normal child data under the same conditions. We hypothesize that typical backpack loads will have a different effect on the lumbar spine of normal and ILBP children. Summary of Background Data Research in normal children shows that backpack loads compress the lumbar IVDs, increase lumbar coronal deformity, and increase pain. Methods Fifteen pediatric and adolescent patients with ILBP were selected. Patients were excluded if a spinal deformity, an underlying pathology, or known injury was identified. A 0.6T upright MRI scanner imaged the subjects while supine and standing wearing 0 kg, 4 kg, and 8 kg backpacks. IVD height, lumbar lordosis, lumbar coronal deformity, and pain score were recorded after each condition and compared using ANOVAs. We compared the above variables between ILBP and normal subjects using generalized least squares models. Results The cohort’s mean age was 13 ± 3 years. The 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks only compressed the L5-S1 IVD relative to upright with no load. Subjects experienced increasing pain with increasing load. Load had no effect on lumbar lordosis or lumbar coronal deformity. Compared to normal children, ILBP children experience significantly less disc compression at T12-L1 to L4-5, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain with increasing load. Conclusions In ILBP children, increasing backpack load compresses only the L5-S1 IVD. Compared to normal children, ILBP children experience less lumbar IVD compression, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain due to increasing load suggesting altered mechanisms for load tolerance in ILBP children.

Spaceflight-induced bone loss alters failure mode and reduces bending strength in murine spinal segments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5477841/,"Intervertebral disc herniation rates are quadrupled in astronauts following spaceflight. While bending motions are main contributors to herniation, the effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs are unknown. Consequently, the goal of this study was to quantify the bending properties of tail discs from mice with or without microgravity exposure. Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (μCT) to quantify bone properties. We observed that spaceflight significantly shortened the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduced the bending strength by 17%. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone. Together, these results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in astronauts.

Spaceflight-associated vascular remodeling and gene expression in mouse calvaria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9139491/,"Astronauts suffer from a loss of bone mass at a rate of 1.5% per month from lower regions of the body during the course of long-duration (>30 days) spaceflight, a phenomenon that poses important risks for returning crew. Conversely, a gain in bone mass may occur in non-load bearing regions of the body as related to microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shift. Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure compared between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts. We examined parasagittal capillary numbers and structures in calvaria from 16 to 23 week-old C57BL/6 female mice (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 5) from STS-131 and 19–20 week-old C57BL/6 male mice (GC, n = 6; SF, n = 6) from BION-M1 using a robust isolectin-IB4 vessel marker. We found that the vessel diameter reduces significantly in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight relative to control. Capillarization increases by 30% (SF vs. GC, p = 0.054) in SF mice compared to GC mice. The vessel numbers and diameter remain unchanged in BION-M1 mice calvarial section. We next analyzed the parietal pro-angiogenic ( VEGFA ) and pro-osteogenic gene ( BMP-2, DMP1, RUNX2 and OCN ) expression in BION-M1 mice using quantitative RT-PCR. VEGFA gene expression increased 15-fold while BMP-2 gene expression increased 11-fold in flight mice compared to GC. The linkage between vascular morphology and gene expression in the SF conditions suggests that angiogenesis may be important in the regulation of pathological bone growth in non-weight bearing regions of the body.

"Exposure of Mycobacterium marinum to low-shear modeled microgravity: Effect on growth, the transcriptome and survival under stress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515531/,"Waterborne pathogenic mycobacteria can form biofilms, and certain species can cause hard-to-treat human lung infections. Astronaut health could therefore be compromised if the spacecraft environment or water becomes contaminated with pathogenic mycobacteria. This work uses Mycobacterium marinum to determine the physiological changes in a pathogenic mycobacteria grown under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG). M. marinum were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or the control orientation (normal gravity, NG) and the cultures used to determine bacterial growth, bacterium size, transcriptome changes, and resistance to stress. Two exposure times to LSMMG and NG were examined: bacteria were grown for ~40 h (short), or 4 days followed by re-dilution and growth for ~35 h (long). M. marinum exposed to LSMMG transitioned from exponential phase earlier than the NG culture. They were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but showed no change in resistance to gamma radiation or pH 3.5. RNA-Seq detected significantly altered transcript levels for 562 and 328 genes under LSMMG after short and long exposure times, respectively. Results suggest that LSMMG induced a reduction in translation, a downregulation of metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and increased chaperone and mycobactin expression. Sigma factor H ( sigH ) was the only sigma factor transcript induced by LSMMG after both short and long exposure times. In summary, transcriptome studies suggest that LSMMG may simulate a nutrient-deprived environment similar to that found within macrophage during infection.

Effects of mechanostimulation on gravitropism and signal persistence in flax roots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3258067/,"Gravitropism describes curvature of plants in response to gravity or differential acceleration and clinorotation is commonly used to compensate unilateral effect of gravity. We report on experiments that examine the persistence of the gravity signal and separate mechanostimulation from gravistimulation.

Image sequences showed that horizontal clinorotation did not affect root growth rate (0.81 ± 0.03 mm h −1 ) but vertical clinorotation reduced root growth by about 7%. The angular velocity (speed of clinorotation) did not affect growth for either direction. However, maximal curvature for vertical clinorotation decreased with increasing rate of rotation and produced straight roots at 5 rpm. In contrast, horizontal clinorotation increased curvature with increasing angular velocity. The point of maximal curvature was used to determine the longevity (memory) of the gravity signal, which lasted about 120 min.

The results showed that the salinity (100 mM NaCl) has significant deleterious impacts on cauliflower seed germination, seedling growth, and photosynthetic attributes, and provoked the production of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, different priming approaches proved beneficial in mitigating the negative effects of salinity and boosted the germination, vigor indices, seedling growth, and physio-biochemical attributes like photosynthetic pigments, protein, and proline content while suppressing oxidative damage and MDA content in cauliflower seedlings in treatment- and dose-dependent manner. PCA revealed 61% (PC1) and 15% (PC2) of the total variance with substantial positive relationships and high loading conditions on all germination attributes on PC1 with greater PC1 scores for PEG treatments showing the increased germination indices in PEG-treated seeds among all the priming treatments tested.

"Desiccation mitigates heat stress in the resurrection fern, Pleopeltis polypodioides",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733933/,"Although heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected hydrated Pleopeltis polypodioides fronds to temperatures up to 50°C and dehydrated fronds up to 65°C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40°C curled tighter and became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 50°C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned partially brown at > 35°C. Chlorophyll fluorescence (F t ) and quantum yield (Q y ) increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40°C treatment lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Similarly, hydrated fronds showed reduced Q y when exposed to > 40°C. Dried and hydrated fronds remained metabolically active up to 40°C. Hydroperoxides and lipid hydroperoxides in dried samples remained high up to 50°C, but decreased in hydrated fronds at > 40°C. Catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) oxidizing activities remained high up to 40°C in dehydrated fronds and up to 35°C in hydrated fronds. Major fatty acids detected in both dehydrated and hydrated fronds included palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2); and linolenic (C18:3) acids. Linolenic acid was most abundant. In dried fronds, all fatty acids decreased at > 35°C.

Transcription profile of auxin related genes during positively gravitropic hypocotyl curvature of Brassica rapa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9105288/,"Unlike typical negative gravitropic curvature, young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa and other dicots exhibit positive gravitropism. This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in both positive and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription of PIN1 , PIN3 , IAA5 and ARG1 in curving tissue. We compared tissue extraction of the convex and concave flank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Based on Ubiquitin1 ( UBQ1 ) as a reference gene, the log (2) fold change of all examined genes was determined. Transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse suggesting that these genes affect differential elongation. The transcription of all genes was upregulated in the lower flank and downregulated in the upper flank during the initial downward curving period. After 48 h, the transcription profile reversed, suggesting that the ensuing negative gravicurvature is controlled by the same genes as the positive gravicurvature. High-spatial resolution profiling using SPGE revealed that the transcription profile of the examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison of the hypocotyl transcription profile with the root tip indicated that the tip tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes.

High-gradient magnetic fields and starch metabolism: Results from a space experiment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9617909/,"Directing plant growth in weightlessness requires understanding the processes that establish plant orientation and how to manipulate them. Both gravi- and phototropism determine directional growth and previous experiments showed that high gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) can induce curvature in roots and shoots. Experiments with Brassica rapa verified that that gravitropism-like induction of curvature is possible in space and that the HGMF-responsive organelles are amyloplasts. We assessed the effect of space and HGMF based on 16 genes and compared their transcription with static growth and clinorotation. Amyloplasts size in root tips increased under weightlessness but decreased under clinorotation but not in response to magnetic fields. Amyloplast size changes were correlated with reduced amylase transcription in space samples and enhanced transcription after clinorotation. Mechanostimulation and weightlessness have opposite effects on the size of amyloplasts. The data show that plants perceive weightlessness, and that their metabolism adjusts to microgravity and mechanostimulation. Thus, clinorotation as surrogate for space research may lead to incorrect interpretations.

Variable but stabilized microdomains form in membranes that include specific lipids and proteins that became known as (detergent-resistant) membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts with various subclassifications. The composition, especially the sterol-dependent recruitment of specific proteins affects endo- and exo-membrane domains as well as plasmodesmata. The enhanced saturated fatty acid content in lipid rafts after clinorotation suggests increased rigidity and reduced membrane permeability as a primary response to abiotic and mechanical stress.

Expression and characterization of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS in Xenopus laevis oocytes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3503204/,"Like many other organisms, plants are capable of sensing and responding to mechanical stimuli such as touch, osmotic pressure, and gravity. One mechanism for the perception of force is the activation of mechanosensitive (or stretch-activated) ion channels, and a number of mechanosensitive channel activities have been described in plant membranes. Based on their homology to the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS, the 10 MscS-Like (MSL) proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana have been hypothesized to form mechanosensitive channels in plant cell and organelle membranes. However, definitive proof that MSLs form mechanosensitive channels has been lacking. Here we used single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology to show that MSL10 is capable of providing a MS channel activity when heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This channel had a conductance of ∼100 pS, consistent with the hypothesis that it underlies an activity previously observed in the plasma membrane of plant root cells. We found that MSL10 formed a channel with a moderate preference for anions, which was modulated by strongly positive and negative membrane potentials, and was reversibly inhibited by gadolinium, a known inhibitor of mechanosensitive channels. MSL10 demonstrated asymmetric activation/inactivation kinetics, with the channel closing at substantially lower tensions than channel opening.

Effects of angular frequency during clinorotation on mesenchymal stem cell morphology and migration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515506/,"Aims: To determine the short-term effects of simulated microgravity on mesenchymal stem cell behaviors—as a function of clinorotation speed—using time-lapse microscopy. Background: Ground-based microgravity simulation can reproduce the apparent effects of weightlessness in spaceflight using clinostats that continuously reorient the gravity vector on a specimen, creating a time-averaged nullification of gravity. In this work, we investigated the effects of clinorotation speed on the morphology, cytoarchitecture, and migration behavior of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Methods: We compared cell responses at clinorotation speeds of 0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm over 8 h in a recently developed lab-on-chip-based clinostat system. Time-lapse light microscopy was used to visualize changes in cell morphology during and after cessation of clinorotation. Cytoarchitecture was assessed by actin and vinculin staining, and chemotaxis was examined using time-lapse light microscopy of cells in NGF (100 ng/ml) gradients. Results: Among clinorotated groups, cell area distributions indicated a greater inhibition of cell spreading with higher angular frequency ( P <0.005), though average cell area at 30 rpm after 8 h became statistically similar to control ( P =0.794). Cells at 75 rpm clinorotation remained viable and were able to re-spread after clinorotation. In chemotaxis chambers, clinorotation did not alter migration patterns in elongated cells, but most clinorotated cells exhibited cell retraction, which strongly compromised motility. Conclusions: These results indicate that hMSCs respond to clinorotation by adopting more rounded, less-spread morphologies. The angular frequency-dependence suggests that a cell’s ability to sense the changing gravity vector is governed by the rate of perturbation. For migration studies, cells cultured in clinorotated chemotaxis chambers were generally less motile and exhibited retraction instead of migration.",aims determine shortterm effects simulated microgravity mesenchymal stem cell behaviorsas function clinorotation speedusing timelapse microscopy background groundbased microgravity simulation reproduce apparent effects weightlessness spaceflight using clinostats continuously reorient gravity vector specimen creating timeaveraged nullification gravity work investigated effects clinorotation speed morphology cytoarchitecture migration behavior human mesenchymal stem cells hmscs methods compared cell responses clinorotation speeds rpm recently developed labonchipbased clinostat system timelapse light microscopy used visualize changes cell morphology cessation clinorotation cytoarchitecture assessed actin vinculin staining chemotaxis examined using timelapse light microscopy cells ngf ngml gradients results among clinorotated groups cell area distributions indicated greater inhibition cell spreading higher angular frequency though average cell area rpm became statistically similar control cells rpm clinorotation remained viable able respread clinorotation chemotaxis chambers clinorotation alter migration patterns elongated cells clinorotated cells exhibited cell retraction strongly compromised motility conclusions results indicate hmscs respond clinorotation adopting rounded lessspread morphologies angular frequencydependence suggests cells ability sense changing gravity vector governed rate perturbation migration studies cells cultured clinorotated chemotaxis chambers generally less motile exhibited retraction instead migration
"The role of FGF-2 and BMP-2 in regulation of gene induction, cell proliferation and mineralization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3044105/,"Introduction The difficulty in re-growing and mineralizing new bone after severe fracture can result in loss of ambulation or limb. Here we describe the sequential roles of FGF-2 in inducing gene expression, cell growth and BMP-2 in gene expression and mineralization of bone. Materials and methods The regulation of gene expression was determined using real-time RTPCR (qRTPCR) and cell proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation or fluorescent analysis of DNA content in MC3T3E1 osteoblast-like cells. Photomicroscopy was used to identify newly mineralized tissue and fluorescence was used to quantify mineralization. Results Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) had the greatest ability to induce proliferation after 24 hours of treatment when compared to transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), bone morphogenic protein (BMP-2), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) or prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ). We found that FGF-2 caused the most significant induction of expression of early growth response-1 ( egr-1), fgf-2, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2), tgfβ and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (mmp-3) associated with proliferation and expression of angiogenic genes like vascular endothelial growth factor A ( vegfA) and its receptor vegfr1 . We found that FGF-2 significantly reduced gene expression associated with mineralization, e.g. collagen type-1 (col1a1), fibronectin (fn), osteocalcin (oc), IGF-1, noggin, bone morphogenic protein (bmp-2) and alkaline phosphatase (alp) . In contrast, BMP-2 significantly stimulated expression of the mineralization associated genes but had little or no effect on gene expression associated with growth. Conclusions The ability of FGF-2 to re-program a mineralizing gene expression profile to one of proliferation suggests that FGF-2 plays a critical role of osteoblast growth in early fracture repair while BMP-2 is instrumental in stimulating mineralization.",introduction difficulty regrowing mineralizing new bone severe fracture result loss ambulation limb describe sequential roles fgf inducing gene expression cell growth bmp gene expression mineralization bone materials methods regulation gene expression determined using realtime rtpcr qrtpcr cell proliferation measured thymidine incorporation fluorescent analysis dna content mcte osteoblastlike cells photomicroscopy used identify newly mineralized tissue fluorescence used quantify mineralization results fibroblast growth factor fgf greatest ability induce proliferation hours treatment compared transforming growth factor beta tgf insulinlike growth factor igf bone morphogenic protein bmp platelet derived growth factor pdgf prostaglandin pge found fgf caused significant induction expression early growth response egr fgf cyclooxygenase cox tgf matrix metalloproteinase mmp associated proliferation expression angiogenic genes like vascular endothelial growth factor vegfa receptor vegfr found fgf significantly reduced gene expression associated mineralization collagen type cola fibronectin osteocalcin igf noggin bone morphogenic protein bmp alkaline phosphatase alp contrast bmp significantly stimulated expression mineralization associated genes little effect gene expression associated growth conclusions ability fgf reprogram mineralizing gene expression profile one proliferation suggests fgf plays critical role osteoblast growth early fracture repair bmp instrumental stimulating mineralization
"Nutritional supplements, COX-2 and IGF-1 expression in men on active surveillance for prostate cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002170/,"Background Nutritional factors are associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer progression, yet mechanisms remain unclear. We examined the effects of lycopene and fish oil supplements versus placebo on the normal prostate microenvironment, among men pursuing active surveillance for low-burden prostate cancer. We hypothesized that lycopene or fish oil supplements would down-regulate insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF - 1 ) and cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX - 2 ) gene expression, respectively, reflecting putative proliferation ( IGF - 1 ) and inflammatory ( COX - 2 ) pathways relevant to carcinogenesis. Methods We conducted a 3-month randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial comparing prostate tissue gene expression profiles (assessed by qRT–PCR) among men with favorable-risk prostate cancer receiving either 30 mg/day lycopene, 3 g/day fish oil (including 1,098 mg eicosapentaenoic and 549 mg docosahexaenoic fatty acid s ) or placebo. Results Among 69 men (22 assigned to lycopene, 21 to fish, and 26 to placebo), there was no difference in the change from baseline to the 3 months in IGF - 1 expression level between the placebo and lycopene arms ( p = 0.93) nor in COX-2 expression between the placebo and fish arms ( p = 0.99). Conclusion Compared to placebo, 3-month intervention with lycopene or fish oil did not significantly change IGF - 1 and COX - 2 gene expression in the normal prostate microenvironment in men with low-burden prostate cancer. Further analysis of global gene expression profiles may shed light on the bioactivity and relevance of these nutrients in prostate cancer.

Hyperoxia inhibits T cell activation in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11470607/,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease in preterm infants, the abnormal proliferate and differentiate ability of type II epithelial cells (AEC II) is the key to the pathological basis of BPD. Mechanisms regarding abnormal AEC II in BPD remain unclear. The present work investigated the role and mechanisms of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in lung disorder in BPD using public datasets, clinical samples, a hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system. Firstly, we found that the NKT cells development factor IL-15 increased over time in patients with BPD in public databases, and clinically collected peripheral blood NKT cells in patients with BPD were increased. Subsequently, the percentage of iNKT cells increased in hyperoxia group compared with normoxia group, with the highest at P7, accompanied by increased activation with abnormal lung development. The administration of anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody to inhibit iNKT cells could alleviate the abnormal lung development of hyperoxia group mice, while α-GalCer administration could aggravate lung injury in hyperoxia group mice, and adoptive transfer of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal lung development in hyperoxia group mice. In addition, to further verify the role of iNKT cells on AEC II, AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture system was established. The presence of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal expression of SP-C and T1α under hyperoxia. Meanwhile, RNA-seq analysis showed that ferroptosis-related genes were highly expressed in AEC II co-cultured with iNKT cells under hyperoxia. We further validated the effect of the presence of iNKT cells under hyperoxia environment on AEC II ferroptosis levels, suggested that iNKT cells promote AEC II ferroptosis under hyperoxia, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α. Our study found that the recruitment of iNKT cells in the lung may be an important cause of alveolarization disorder in BPD.

"Effects of gravitational mechanical unloading in endothelial cells: association between caveolins, inflammation and adhesion molecules",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603133/,"Mechanical forces including gravity affect endothelial cell (ECs) function, and have been implicated in vascular disease as well as physiologic changes associated with low gravity environments. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading on ECs phenotype as determined by patterns of gene expression. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were exposed to 1-gravity environment or mechanical unloading (MU) for 24 hours, with or without periods of mechanical loading (ML). MU led to a significant decrease in gene expression of several adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the contrary, eNOS, Caveolin-1 and -2 expression were significantly increased with MU. There was a decrease in the length and width of the cells with MU. Addition of ML during the MU period was sufficient to reverse the changes triggered by MU. Our results suggest that gravitational loading could dramatically affect vascular endothelial cell function.",mechanical forces including gravity affect endothelial cell ecs function implicated vascular disease well physiologic changes associated low gravity environments goal study investigate impact gravitational mechanical unloading ecs phenotype determined patterns gene expression human umbilical vascular endothelial cells exposed gravity environment mechanical unloading hours without periods mechanical loading led significant decrease gene expression several adhesion molecules proinflammatory cytokines contrary enos caveolin expression significantly increased decrease length width cells addition period sufficient reverse changes triggered results suggest gravitational loading could dramatically affect vascular endothelial cell function
n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation in peripheral artery disease: the OMEGA-PAD trial,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6462350/,"Background: N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation has been associated with reduced mortality and inflammation in patients with cardiovascular disease. There are limited data on the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Materials and methods: The OMEGA-PAD II trial was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of 3 mo of high-dose oral n-3 PUFA supplementation on inflammation, endothelial function, and walking ability in patients with PAD. Results: Twenty-four patients with claudication received 4.4 g/d of fish oil or placebo for 3 mo. Outcomes measured included high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, the omega-3 index, endothelial function as measured via flow-mediated vasodilation, walking impairment questionnaire, and a 6-min walk test. Plasma levels of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) were measured by liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In patients treated with fish oil, the absolute mean omega-3 index significantly increased from baseline (fish oil: 7.2 ± 1.2%, P < 0.001; placebo: −0.4 ± 0.9%, P = 0.31; between-group P < 0.001). Furthermore, there were significant increases in several pathway markers of SPM biosynthesis, including several mono-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids and mono-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acids. We also observed significant increases in the SPM lipoxin A 5 (fish oil: 0.57 ± 0.70 pg/mL, P = 0.05; placebo: 0.01 ± 0.38 pg/mL, P = 0.93; between-group P = 0.04) and resolvin E3 (fish oil: 154 ± 171 pg/mL, P = 0.04; placebo: 32 ± 54 pg/mL, P = 0.08; between-group P = 0.04). There were no significant changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, flow-mediated vasodilation, walking impairment questionnaire, or 6-min walk test in the fish oil group. Conclusions: Fish oil increases SPMs in plasma of patients with PAD. Further studies are required to determine whether these early changes translate to clinical improvements in patients with PAD.

Molecular mechanisms underlying the enhanced functions of three-dimensional hepatocyte aggregates,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012541/,"Three-dimensional (3D) culture of hepatocytes leads to improved and prolonged synthetic and metabolic functions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. In order to investigate the role of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining hepatocyte differentiated functions ex vivo , primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured either as monolayers on tissue culture dishes (TCD) or as 3D aggregates in rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. Global gene expression analyses revealed that genes upregulated in 3D culture were distinct from those upregulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Instead, they represented a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes with significant over-representation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α ( Hnf4a ) binding sites in their promoters. Expression of Hnf4a and many of its downstream target genes were significantly increased in RWV cultures as compared to TCD. Conversely, there was concomitant suppression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes in RWV cultures that were induced in TCDs. These findings illustrate the importance of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining fundamental molecular pathways of hepatocyte function and serve as a basis for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte functions ex vivo for biomedical applications.

Spaceflight alters expression of microRNA during T-cell activation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4653058/,"Altered immune function has been demonstrated in astronauts during spaceflights dating back to Apollo and Skylab; this could be a major barrier to long-term space exploration. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight causes changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression. Human leukocytes were stimulated with mitogens on board the International Space Station using an onboard normal gravity control. Bioinformatics showed that miR-21 was significantly up-regulated 2-fold during early T-cell activation in normal gravity, and gene expression was suppressed under microgravity. This was confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR ( n = 4). This is the first report that spaceflight regulates miRNA expression. Global microarray analysis showed significant ( P < 0.05) suppression of 85 genes under microgravity conditions compared to normal gravity samples. EGR3 , FASLG, BTG2, SPRY2, and TAGAP are biologically confirmed targets and are co-up-regulated with miR-21. These genes share common promoter regions with pre-mir-21; as the miR-21 matures and accumulates, it most likely will inhibit translation of its target genes and limit the immune response. These data suggest that gravity regulates T-cell activation not only by transcription promotion but also by blocking translation via noncoding RNA mechanisms. Moreover, this study suggests that T-cell activation itself may induce a sequence of gene expressions that is self-limited by miR-21.—Hughes-Fulford, M., Chang, T. T., Martinez, E. M., Li, C.-F.

Spaceflight impairs antigen-specific tolerance induction in vivo and increases inflammatory cytokines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6137544/,"The health risks of a dysregulated immune response during spaceflight are important to understand as plans emerge for humans to embark on long-term space travel to Mars. In this first-of-its-kind study, we used adoptive transfer of T-cell receptor transgenic OT-II CD4 T cells to track an in vivo antigen-specific immune response that was induced during the course of spaceflight. Experimental mice destined for spaceflight and mice that remained on the ground received transferred OT-II cells and cognate peptide stimulation with ovalbumin (OVA) 323-339 plus the inflammatory adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A. Control mice in both flight and ground cohorts received monophosphoryl lipid A alone without additional OVA stimulation. Numbers of OT-II cells in flight mice treated with OVA were significantly increased by 2-fold compared with ground mice treated with OVA, suggesting that tolerance induction was impaired by spaceflight. Production of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in flight compared with ground mice, including a 5-fold increase in IFN-γ and a 10-fold increase in IL-17.

"From cellular mechanotransduction to biologically inspired engineering: 2009 Pritzker Award Lecture, BMES Annual Meeting October 10, 2009.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2913424/,"This article is based on a lecture I presented as the recipient of the 2009 Pritzker Distinguished Lecturer Award at the Biomedical Engineering Society annual meeting in October 2009. Here, I review more than thirty years of research from my laboratory, beginning with studies designed to test the theory that cells use tensegrity (tensional integrity) architecture to stabilize their shape and sense mechanical signals, which I believed to be critical for control of cell function and tissue development. Although I was trained as a cell biologist, I found that the tools I had at my disposal were insufficient to experimentally test these theories, and thus I ventured into engineering to find critical solutions. This path has been extremely fruitful as it has led to confirmation of the critical role that physical forces play in developmental control, as well as how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals at the molecular level through a process known as cellular mechanotransduction. Many of the predictions of the cellular tensegrity model relating to cell mechanical behaviors have been shown to be valid, and this vision of cell structure led to discovery of the central role that transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as integrins, and the cytoskeleton play in mechanosensing and mechanochemical conversion. In addition, these fundamental studies have led to significant unexpected technology fallout, including development of micromagnetic actuators for non-invasive control of cellular signaling, microfluidic systems as therapeutic extracorporeal devices for sepsis therapy, and new DNA-based nanobiotechnology approaches that permit construction of artificial tensegrities that mimic properties of living materials for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

Crewmember microbiome may influence microbial composition of ISS habitable surfaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190111/,"The International Space Station (ISS) is a complex built environment physically isolated from Earth. Assessing the interplay between the microbial community of the ISS and its crew is important for preventing biomedical and structural complications for long term human spaceflight missions. In this study, we describe one crewmember’s microbial profile from body swabs of mouth, nose, ear, skin and saliva that were collected at eight different time points pre-, during and post-flight. Additionally, environmental surface samples from eight different habitable locations in the ISS were collected from two flights. Environmental samples from one flight were collected by the crewmember and samples from the next flight were collected after the crewmember departed. The microbial composition in both environment and crewmember samples was measured using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and processed using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit. Ordination of sample to sample distances showed that of the eight crew body sites analyzed, skin, nostril, and ear samples are more similar in microbial composition to the ISS surfaces than mouth and saliva samples; and that the microbial composition of the crewmember’s skin samples are more closely related to the ISS surface samples collected by the crewmember on the same flight than ISS surface samples collected by other crewmembers on different flights. In these collections, species alpha diversity in saliva samples appears to decrease during flight and rebound after returning to Earth. This is the first study to compare the ISS microbiome to a crewmember’s microbiome via shotgun metagenomic sequencing.

Sierra Nevada sweep: Metagenomic measurements of bioaerosols vertically distributed across the troposphere.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7382458/,"To explore how airborne microbial patterns change with height above the Earth’s surface, we flew NASA’s C-20A aircraft on two consecutive days in June 2018 along identical flight paths over the US Sierra Nevada mountain range at four different altitudes ranging from 10,000 ft to 40,000 ft. Bioaerosols were analyzed by metagenomic DNA sequencing and traditional culturing methods to characterize the composition and diversity of atmospheric samples compared to experimental controls. The relative abundance of taxa changed significantly at each altitude sampled, and the diversity profile shifted across the two sampling days, revealing a regional atmospheric microbiome that is dynamically changing. The most proportionally abundant microbial genera were Mycobacterium and Achromobacter at 10,000 ft; Stenotrophomonas and Achromobacter at 20,000 ft; Delftia and Pseudoperonospora at 30,000 ft; and Alcaligenes and Penicillium at 40,000 ft. Culture-based detections also identified viable Bacillus zhangzhouensis , Bacillus pumilus , and Bacillus spp. in the upper troposphere. To estimate bioaerosol dispersal, we developed a human exposure likelihood model (7-day forecast) using general aerosol characteristics and measured meteorological conditions.

"Microbial tracking-2, a metagenomics analysis of bacteria and fungi onboard the International Space Station.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9241228/,"Background The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and complex built environment with the ISS surface microbiome originating from crew and cargo or from life support recirculation in an almost entirely closed system. The Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole-genome amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights from the same locations, over another 14 months. Methods Eight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and processed upon return to Earth. DNA extracted from the processed samples (and controls) were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to detect intact/viable cells or left untreated and to detect the total DNA population (free DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells). DNA extracted from PMA-treated and untreated samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Samples were cultured for bacteria and fungi to supplement the above results. Results Staphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. Overall, the ISS surface microbiome was dominated by organisms associated with the human skin. Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant temporal changes in the microbial population but no spatial differences. The ISS antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were however more stable over time, with no differences over the 5-year span of the MT-1 and MT-2 studies. Twenty-nine antimicrobial resistance genes were detected across all samples, with macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses showed strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera. Culture analysis showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 × 10 5 cfu/m 2 Conclusions Utilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome. Data from this study may help to inform policies for future space missions to ensure an ISS surface microbiome that promotes astronaut health and spacecraft integrity.

Detection of Target Genes for Drug Repurposing to Treat Skeletal Muscle Atrophy in Mice Flown in Spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8953707/,"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a common condition in aging, diabetes, and in long duration spaceflights due to microgravity. This article investigates multi-modal gene disease and disease drug networks via link prediction algorithms to select drugs for repurposing to treat skeletal muscle atrophy. Key target genes that cause muscle atrophy in the left and right extensor digitorum longus muscle tissue, gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and the left and right soleus muscles are detected using graph theoretic network analysis, by mining the transcriptomic datasets collected from mice flown in spaceflight made available by GeneLab. We identified the top muscle atrophy gene regulators by the Pearson correlation and Bayesian Markov blanket method. The gene disease knowledge graph was constructed using the scalable precision medicine knowledge engine. We computed node embeddings, random walk measures from the networks. Graph convolutional networks, graph neural networks, random forest, and gradient boosting methods were trained using the embeddings, network features for predicting links and ranking top gene-disease associations for skeletal muscle atrophy. Drugs were selected and a disease drug knowledge graph was constructed. Link prediction methods were applied to the disease drug networks to identify top ranked drugs for therapeutic treatment of skeletal muscle atrophy. The graph convolution network performs best in link prediction based on receiver operating characteristic curves and prediction accuracies. The key genes involved in skeletal muscle atrophy are associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. The drugs selected for repurposing using the graph convolution network method were nutrients, corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory medications, and others related to insulin.

Release of CD36-associated cell-free mitochondrial DNA and RNA as a hallmark of space environment response,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166646/,"A detailed understanding of how spaceflight affects human health is essential for long-term space exploration. Liquid biopsies allow for minimally-invasive multi-omics assessments that can resolve the molecular heterogeneity of internal tissues. Here, we report initial results from the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome Study, a liquid biopsy study with six astronauts who resided on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than 120 days. Analysis of plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) collected before, during, and after spaceflight confirms previously reported mitochondrial dysregulation in space. Screening with 361 cell surface marker antibodies identifies a mitochondrial DNA-enriched fraction associated with the scavenger receptor CD36. RNA-sequencing of the CD36 fraction reveals tissue-enriched RNA species, suggesting the plasma mitochondrial components originated from various tissues. We compare our plasma cfRNA data to mouse plasma cfRNA data from a previous JAXA mission, which had used on-board artificial gravity, and discover a link between microgravity and the observed mitochondrial responses.

Increasing the number of unloading/reambulation cycles does not adversely impac body composition and lumbar bone mineral density but reduces tissue sensitivity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747666/,"A single exposure to hindlimb unloading leads to changes in body mass, body composition and bone, but the consequences of multiple exposures are not yet understood. Within a 18wk period, adult C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to one (1x-HLU), two (2x-HLU) or three (3x-HLU) cycles of 2 wk of hindlimb unloading (HLU) followed by 4 wk of reambulation (RA), or served as ambulatory age-matched controls. In vivo µCT longitudinally tracked changes in abdominal adipose and lean tissues, lumbar vertebral apparent volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area before and after the final HLU and RA cycle. Significant decreases in total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD were observed such that all unloaded animals reached similar values after the final unloading cycle. However, the magnitude of these losses diminished in mice undergoing their 2 nd or 3 rd HLU cycle. Irrespective of the number of HLU/RA cycles, total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD recovered and were no different from age-matched controls after the final RA period. In contrast, upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area was significantly lower than controls in all unloaded groups after the final RA period. These results suggest that tissues in the abdominal region are more resilient to multiple bouts of unloading and more amenable to recovery during reambulation than the peripheral musculoskeletal system.

Bone shaft bending strength index is unaffected by exercise and unloading in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4337661/,"Anthropologists frequently use the shaft bending strength index to infer the physical activity levels of humans living in the past from their lower limb bone remains. This index is typically calculated as the ratio of bone shaft second moments of area about orthogonal principal axes (i.e. I max / I min ). Individuals with high I max / I min values are inferred to have been very active, whereas individuals with low values are inferred to have been more sedentary. However, there is little direct evidence that activity has a causal and predictable effect on the shaft bending strength index. Here, we report the results of two experiments that were designed to test the model within which anthropologists commonly interpret the shaft bending strength index. In the first experiment, mice were treated daily with treadmill exercise for 1 month to simulate a high-activity lifestyle. In the second experiment, in an attempt to simulate a low-activity lifestyle, functional weight-bearing was removed from the hindlimbs of mice for 1 month. Femoral mid-shaft structure was determined with μCT. We found that while exercise resulted in significant enhancement of I max and I min compared with controls, it failed to significantly increase the I max / I min index. Similarly, stunted bone growth caused by unloading resulted in significantly diminished I max and I min compared with controls, but low activity did not lead to significantly decreased I max / I min compared with normal activity. Together, these results suggest that caution is required when the bone shaft bending strength index is used to reconstruct the activity levels of past humans.

Focal enhancement of the skeleton to exercise correlates to mesenchymal stem cell responsivity rather than peak external forces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631774/,"Force magnitudes have been suggested to drive the structural response of bone to exercise. As importantly, the degree to which any given bone can adapt to functional challenges may be enabled, or constrained, by regional variation in the capacity of marrow progenitors to differentiate into bone-forming cells. Here, we investigate the relationship between bone adaptation and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) responsivity in growing mice subject to exercise. First, using a force plate, we show that peak external forces generated by forelimbs during quadrupedal locomotion are significantly higher than hindlimb forces. Second, by subjecting mice to treadmill running and then measuring bone structure with μCT, we show that skeletal effects of exercise are site-specific but not defined by load magnitudes. Specifically, in the forelimb, where external forces generated by running were highest, exercise failed to augment diaphyseal structure in either the humerus or radius, nor did it affect humeral trabecular structure. In contrast, in the ulna, femur and tibia, exercise led to significant enhancements of diaphyseal bone areas and moments of area. Trabecular structure was also enhanced by running in the femur and tibia. Finally, using flow cytometry, we show that marrow-derived MSCs in the femur are more responsive to exercise-induced loads than humeral cells, such that running significantly lowered MSC populations only in the femur. Together, these data suggest that the ability of the progenitor population to differentiate toward osteoblastogenesis may correlate better with bone structural adaptation than peak external forces caused by exercise.

"Cytoskeletal configuration modulates mechanically induced changes in mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis, morphology, and stiffness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5052530/,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) responding to mechanical cues generated by physical activity is critical for skeletal development and remodeling. Here, we utilized low intensity vibrations (LIV) as a physiologically relevant mechanical signal and hypothesized that the confined cytoskeletal configuration imposed by 2D culture will enable human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSC) to respond more robustly when LIV is applied in-plane (horizontal-LIV) rather than out-of-plane (vertical-LIV). All LIV signals enhanced hBMSC proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and upregulated genes associated with cytoskeletal structure. The cellular response was more pronounced at higher frequencies (100 Hz vs 30 Hz) and when applied in the horizontal plane. Horizontal but not vertical LIV realigned the cell cytoskeleton, culminating in increased cell stiffness. Our results show that applying very small oscillatory motions within the primary cell attachment plane, rather than perpendicular to it, amplifies the cell’s response to LIV, ostensibly facilitating a more effective transfer of intracellular forces.

Genetic and tissue level muscle-bone interactions during unloading and reambulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114340/,"Little is known about interactions between muscle and bone during the removal and application of mechanical signals. Here, we applied 3wk of hindlimb unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation to a genetically heterogeneous population of 352 adult mice and tested the hypothesis that changes in muscle are associated with changes in bone at the level of the tissue and the genome. During unloading and relative to normally ambulating control mice, most mice lost muscle and cortical bone with large variability across the population. During reambulation, individual mice regained bone and muscle at different rates. Across mice, changes in muscle and trabecular/cortical bone were not correlated to each other during unloading or reambulation. For unloading, we found one significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for muscle area and five QTLs for cortical bone without overlap between mechano-sensitive muscle and cortical bone QTLs (but some overlap between muscle and trabecular QTLs). The low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response indicate that the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-adjusts its size during (un)loading may need to be reassessed.

Osteocyte apoptosis caused by hindlimb unloading is required to trigger osteocyte RANKL production and subsequent resorption of cortical and trabecular bone in mice femurs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5488280/,"Osteocyte apoptosis is essential to activate bone remodeling in response to fatigue microdamage and estrogen withdrawal, such that apoptosis inhibition in vivo prevents the onset of osteoclastic resorption. Osteocyte apoptosis has also been spatially linked to bone resorption owing to disuse, but whether apoptosis plays a similar controlling role is unclear. We, therefore, 1) evaluated the spatial and temporal effects of disuse from hindlimb unloading (HLU) on osteocyte apoptosis, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) expression, bone resorption, and loss in mouse femora, and 2) tested whether osteocyte apoptosis was required to activate osteoclastic activity in cortical and trabecular bone by treating animals subjected to HLU with the pan-caspase apoptosis inhibitor, QVD (quinolyl-valyl-O-methylaspartyl-[-2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methylketone). Immunohistochemistry was used to identify apoptotic and RANKL-producing osteocytes in femoral diaphysis and distal trabecular bone, and μCT was used to determine the extent of trabecular bone loss owing to HLU. In both cortical and trabecular bone, 5 days of HLU increased osteocyte apoptosis significantly (3- and 4-fold, respectively, p < 0.05 versus Ctrl). At day 14, the apoptotic osteocyte number in femoral cortices declined to near control levels but remained elevated in trabeculae (3-fold versus Ctrl, p < 0.05). The number of osteocytes producing RANKL in both bone compartments was also significantly increased at day 5 of HLU (>1.5-fold versus Ctrl, p <0.05) and further increased by day 14. Increases in osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL production preceded increases in bone resorption at both endocortical and trabecular surfaces. QVD completely inhibited not only the HLU-triggered increases in osteocyte apoptosis but also RANKL production and activation of bone resorption at both sites. Finally, μCT studies revealed that apoptosis inhibition completely prevented the trabecular bone loss caused by HLU. Together these data indicate that osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in triggering osteocyte RANKL production and the activation of new resorption leading to bone loss in disuse.",osteocyte apoptosis essential activate bone remodeling response fatigue microdamage estrogen withdrawal apoptosis inhibition vivo prevents onset osteoclastic resorption osteocyte apoptosis also spatially linked bone resorption owing disuse whether apoptosis plays similar controlling role unclear therefore evaluated spatial temporal effects disuse hindlimb unloading hlu osteocyte apoptosis receptor activator nfb ligand rankl expression bone resorption loss mouse femora tested whether osteocyte apoptosis required activate osteoclastic activity cortical trabecular bone treating animals subjected hlu pancaspase apoptosis inhibitor qvd quinolylvalylomethylaspartyldifluorophenoxymethylketone immunohistochemistry used identify apoptotic ranklproducing osteocytes femoral diaphysis distal trabecular bone used determine extent trabecular bone loss owing hlu cortical trabecular bone days hlu increased osteocyte apoptosis significantly fold respectively versus ctrl day apoptotic osteocyte number femoral cortices declined near control levels remained elevated trabeculae fold versus ctrl number osteocytes producing rankl bone compartments also significantly increased day hlu fold versus ctrl increased day increases osteocyte apoptosis rankl production preceded increases bone resorption endocortical trabecular surfaces qvd completely inhibited hlutriggered increases osteocyte apoptosis also rankl production activation bone resorption sites finally studies revealed apoptosis inhibition completely prevented trabecular bone loss caused hlu together data indicate osteocyte apoptosis plays central controlling role triggering osteocyte rankl production activation new resorption leading bone loss disuse
Differential Single Cell Responses of Embryonic Stem Cells Versus Embryoid Bodies to Gravity Mechanostimulation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9293686/,"The forces generated by gravity have shaped life on Earth and impact gene expression and morphogenesis during early development. Conversely, disuse on Earth or during spaceflight, reduces normal mechanical loading of organisms, resulting in altered cell and tissue function. Although gravity mechanical loading in adult mammals is known to promote increased cell proliferation and differentiation, little is known about how distinct cell types respond to gravity mechanostimulation during early development. In this study we sought to understand, with single cell RNA-sequencing resolution, how a 60-min pulse of 50 g hypergravity (HG)/5 kPa hydrostatic pressure, influences transcriptomic regulation of developmental processes in the embryoid body (EB) model. Our study included both day-9 EBs and progenitor mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with or without the HG pulse. Single cell t-distributed stochastic neighbor mapping shows limited transcriptome shifts in response to the HG pulse in either ESCs or EBs; this pulse however, induces greater positional shifts in EB mapping compared to ESCs, indicating the influence of mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later states of cell commitment within the developmental program. More specifically, HG resulted in upregulation of self-renewal and angiogenesis genes in ESCs, while in EBs, HG loading was associated with upregulation of Gene Ontology-pathways for multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, and DNA damage repair. Cluster transcriptome analysis of the EBs show HG promotes maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in early development; including EB cluster co-expression of markers for progenitor, post-implant epiblast, and primitive endoderm phenotypes with HG pulse but expression exclusivity in the non-pulsed clusters. Pseudotime analysis identified three branching cell types susceptible to HG induction of cell fate decisions. In totality, this study provides novel evidence that ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by gravity mechanostimulation and that stem cells committed to a differentiation program are more sensitive to gravity-induced changes to their transcriptome.

Macrophages inhibit Aspergillus fumigatus germination and neutrophil-mediated fungal killing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6091969/,"In immunocompromised individuals, Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive fungal disease that is often difficult to treat. Exactly how immune mechanisms control A . fumigatus in immunocompetent individuals remains unclear. Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae to visualize and quantify neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to different A . fumigatus strains. We find that macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a protective niche for fungal survival. Macrophages exert these protective effects by inhibiting fungal germination, thereby inhibiting subsequent neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as faster-growing CEA10-derived strains are killed better in vivo than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Additionally, a CEA10 pyrG -deficient strain with impaired germination is cleared less effectively by neutrophils. Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a CEA10-derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, further demonstrating the role of fungal-intrinsic differences in the ability of a host to clear an infection.

Contributions of spore secondary metabolites to UV-C protection and virulence vary in different Aspergillus fumigatus strains,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7029147/,"Fungal spores contain secondary metabolites that can protect them from a multitude of abiotic and biotic stresses. Conidia (asexual spores) of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus synthesize several metabolites, including melanin, which has been reported to be important for virulence in this species and to be protective against UV radiation in other fungi. Here, we investigate the role of melanin in diverse isolates of A. fumigatus and find variability in its ability to protect spores from UV-C radiation or impact virulence in a zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis in two clinical strains and one ISS strain. Further, we assess the role of other spore metabolites in a clinical strain of A. fumigatus and identify fumiquinazoline as an additional UV-C-protective molecule but not a virulence determinant. The results show differential roles of secondary metabolites in spore protection dependent on the environmental stress and strain of A. fumigatus .

Regulation of hemocytes in Drosophila requires dappled cytochrome b5.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3092937/,"A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is melanotic tumors or nodules, which consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells, similar to granulomas. Our analyses of the melanotic mutant dappled have revealed a novel type of gene involved in blood cell regulation. The dappled gene is an essential gene that encodes cytochrome b5, a conserved hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways. Viable mutations of dappled cause melanotic nodules and hemocyte misregulation during both hematopoietic waves of development. The sexes are similarly affected, but hemocyte number is different in females and males of both mutants and wild type. Additionally, initial tests show that curcumin enhances the dappled melanotic phenotype and establish screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds as a route for analysis of cytochrome b5 function. Overall, dappled provides a tractable genetic model for cytochrome b5, which has been difficult to study in higher organisms.

A novel phototropic response to red light is revealed in microgravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5748516/,"Main conclusion Blue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity. Due to their sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1 g . A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1 g . In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination. In addition, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be affected by directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the first description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravities.

The availability of water and light, as well as the presence of a constant gravity vector, are all environmental stimuli that plants sense and respond to via directed growth movements (tropisms). The plant response to gravity (gravitropism) and the response to unidirectional light (phototropism) have long been shown to be interconnected growth phenomena. Here, we discuss the similarities in these two processes, as well as the known molecular mechanisms behind the tropistic responses. We also highlight research done in a microgravity environment in order to decouple two tropisms through experiments carried out in the absence of a significant unilateral gravity vector. In addition, alteration of gravity, especially the microgravity environment, and light irradiation produce important effects on meristematic cells, the undifferentiated, highly proliferating, totipotent cells which sustain plant development. Microgravity produces the disruption of meristematic competence, i.e., the decoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth, affecting the regulation of the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis. Light irradiation, especially red light, mediated by phytochromes, has an activating effect on these processes. Phytohormones, particularly auxin, also are key mediators in these alterations. Upcoming experiments on the International Space Station will clarify some of the mechanisms and molecular players of the plant responses to these environmental signals involved in tropisms and the cell cycle.

Comparative transcriptomics indicate changes in cell wall organization and stress response in seedlings during spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5821596/,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY Plants will play an important role in the future of space exploration as part of bioregenerative life support. Thus, it is important to understand the effects of microgravity and spaceflight on gene expression in plant development. METHODS We analyzed the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana using the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware during Space Shuttle mission STS-131. The bioinformatics methods used included RMA (robust multi-array average), MAS5 (Microarray Suite 5.0), and PLIER (probe logarithmic intensity error estimation). Glycome profiling was used to analyze cell wall composition in the samples. In addition, our results were compared to those of two other groups using the same hardware on the same mission (BRIC-16). KEY RESULTS In our BRIC-16 experiments, we noted expression changes in genes involved in hypoxia and heat shock responses, DNA repair, and cell wall structure between spaceflight samples compared to the ground controls. In addition, glycome profiling supported our expression analyses in that there was a difference in cell wall components between ground control and spaceflight-grown plants. Comparing our studies to those of the other BRIC-16 experiments demonstrated that, even with the same hardware and similar biological materials, differences in results in gene expression were found among these spaceflight experiments. C ONCLUSIONS A common theme from our BRIC-16 space experiments and those of the other two groups was the downregulation of water stress response genes in spaceflight. In addition, all three studies found differential regulation of genes associated with cell wall remodeling and stress responses between spaceflight-grown and ground control plants.

RNAseq analysis of the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to fractional gravity under blue-light stimulation during spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6889863/,"Introduction: Traveling to nearby extraterrestrial objects having a reduced gravity level (partial gravity) compared to Earth’s gravity is becoming a realistic objective for space agencies. The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses including tropisms, under partial gravity conditions. Materials and Methods: Here, we present results from our latest space experiments on the ISS, in which seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro- g , several intermediate partial- g levels, and 1 g , and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 h. RNA was extracted from 20 samples for subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized for global responses using the GEDI tool, gene networks and for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment. Results: Differential gene expression analysis revealed only one differentially expressed gene (AT4G21560, VPS28-1 a vacuolar protein) across all gravity conditions using FDR correction (q < 0.05). However, the same 14 genes appeared differentially expressed when comparing either micro- g , low- g level (< 0.1 g ) or the Moon g -level with 1 g control conditions. Apart from these 14-shared genes, the number of differentially expressed genes was similar in microgravity and the Moon g -level and increased in the intermediate g -level (< 0.1 g ), but it was then progressively reduced as the difference with the Earth gravity became smaller. The GO groups were differentially affected at each g -level: light and photosynthesis GO under microgravity, genes belonged to general stress, chemical and hormone responses under low- g , and a response related to cell wall and membrane structure and function under the Moon g -level. Discussion: Transcriptional analyses of plants under blue light stimulation suggests that root blue-light phototropism may be enough to reduce the gravitational stress response caused by the lack of gravitropism in microgravity. Competition among tropisms induces an intense perturbation at the micro- g level, which shows an extensive stress response that is progressively attenuated. Our results show a major effect on cell wall/membrane remodeling (detected at the interval from the Moon to Mars gravity), which can be potentially related to graviresistance mechanisms.

Comparison of Microgravity Analogs to Spaceflight in Studies of Plant Growth and Development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6908503/,"Life on Earth has evolved under the influence of gravity. This force has played an important role in shaping development and morphology from the molecular level to the whole organism. Although aquatic life experiences reduced gravity effects, land plants have evolved under a 1- g environment. Understanding gravitational effects requires changing the magnitude of this force. One method of eliminating gravity'’s influence is to enter into a free-fall orbit around the planet, thereby achieving a balance between centripetal force of gravity and the centrifugal force of the moving object. This balance is often mistakenly referred to as microgravity, but is best described as weightlessness. In addition to actually compensating gravity, instruments such as clinostats, random-positioning machines (RPM), and magnetic levitation devices have been used to eliminate effects of constant gravity on plant growth and development. However, these platforms do not reduce gravity but constantly change its direction. Despite these fundamental differences, there are few studies that have investigated the comparability between these platforms and weightlessness. Here, we provide a review of the strengths and weaknesses of these analogs for the study of plant growth and development compared to spaceflight experiments. We also consider reduced or partial gravity effects via spaceflight and analog methods. While these analogs are useful, the fidelity of the results relative to spaceflight depends on biological parameters and environmental conditions that cannot be simulated in ground-based studies.

The importance of Earth reference controls in spaceflight-omics research: Characterization of nucleolin mutants from the Seedling Growth experiments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607443/,"Summary Understanding plant adaptive responses to the space environment is a requisite for enabling space farming. Spaceflight produces deleterious effects on plant cells, particularly affecting ribosome biogenesis, a complex stress-sensitive process coordinated with cell division and differentiation, known to be activated by red light. Here, in a series of ground studies, we have used mutants from the two Arabidopsis nucleolin genes ( NUC1 and NUC2, nucleolar regulators of ribosome biogenesis) to better understand their role in adaptive response mechanisms to stress on Earth. Thus, we show that nucleolin stress-related gene NUC2 can compensate for the environmental stress provided by darkness in nuc1 plants, whereas nuc2 plants are not able to provide a complete response to red light. These ground control findings, as part of the ESA/NASA Seedling Growth spaceflight experiments, will determine the basis for the identification of genetic backgrounds enabling an adaptive advantage for plants in future space experiments.

Conducting plant experiments in space and on the Moon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10764921/,"Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing effective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa (commonly known as “ water lentils ” or “ duckweed ”), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random positioning machines and the large-diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa. The relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity were reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed differences in plant dimensions and frond length-to-width ratios under diverse gravity conditions. Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and morphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for other crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained substantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions.

Red light enhances plant adaptation to spaceflight and Mars g-levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9605285/,"Understanding how plants respond and adapt to extraterrestrial conditions is essential for space exploration initiatives. Deleterious effects of the space environment on plant development have been reported, such as the unbalance of cell growth and proliferation in the root meristem, or gene expression reprogramming. However, plants are capable of surviving and completing the seed-to-seed life cycle under microgravity. A key research challenge is to identify environmental cues, such as light, which could compensate the negative effects of microgravity. Understanding the crosstalk between light and gravity sensing in space was the major objective of the NASA-ESA Seedling Growth series of spaceflight experiments (2013–2018). Different g -levels were used, with special attention to micro- g , Mars- g , and Earth- g . In spaceflight seedlings illuminated for 4 days with a white light photoperiod and then photostimulated with red light for 2 days, transcriptomic studies showed, first, that red light partially reverted the gene reprogramming induced by microgravity, and that the combination of microgravity and photoactivation was not recognized by seedlings as stressful. Two mutant lines of the nucleolar protein nucleolin exhibited differential requirements in response to red light photoactivation. This observation opens the way to directed-mutagenesis strategies in crop design to be used in space colonization. Further transcriptomic studies at different g -levels showed elevated plastid and mitochondrial genome expression in microgravity, associated with disturbed nucleus–organelle communication, and the upregulation of genes encoding auxin and cytokinin hormonal pathways. At the Mars g -level, genes of hormone pathways related to stress response were activated, together with some transcription factors specifically related to acclimation, suggesting that seedlings grown in partial- g are able to acclimate by modulating genome expression in routes related to space-environment-associated stress.

EUK-134 ameliorates nNOS¬µ translocation and skeletal muscle fiber atrophy during short-term mechanical unloading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3962621/,"Reduced mechanical loading during bedrest, spaceflight, and casting, causes rapid morphological changes in skeletal muscle: fiber atrophy and reduction of slow-twitch fibers. An emerging signaling event in response to unloading is the translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSμ) from the sarcolemma to the cytosol. We used EUK-134, a cell-permeable mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase, to test the role of redox signaling in nNOSμ translocation and muscle fiber atrophy as a result of short-term (54 h) hindlimb unloading. Fischer-344 rats were divided into ambulatory control, hindlimb-unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded + EUK-134 (HU-EUK) groups. EUK-134 mitigated the unloading-induced phenotype, including muscle fiber atrophy and muscle fiber-type shift from slow to fast. nNOSμ immunolocalization at the sarcolemma of the soleus was reduced with HU, while nNOSμ protein content in the cytosol increased with unloading. Translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemma to cytosol was virtually abolished by EUK-134. EUK-134 also mitigated dephosphorylation at Thr-32 of FoxO3a during HU. Hindlimb unloading elevated oxidative stress (4-hydroxynonenal) and increased sarcolemmal localization of Nox2 subunits gp91phox (Nox2) and p47phox, effects normalized by EUK-134. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative stress triggers nNOSμ translocation from the sarcolemma and FoxO3a dephosphorylation as an early event during mechanical unloading. Thus, redox signaling may serve as a biological switch for nNOS to initiate morphological changes in skeletal muscle fibers.

MnSOD Overexpression Reduces Fibrosis and Pro-Apoptotic Signaling in the Aging Mouse Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462657/,"Contractility of the heart is impaired with advancing age via mechanical remodeling, as myocytes are lost through apoptosis and collagenous fibers accumulate. Exercise training confers protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We recently reported that exercise training elevates Mn isoform of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the aging heart, concomitant with reduction in oxidative stress and fibrosis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of MnSOD would be causal in protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart. Hearts were extracted from young (8 months) wild-type, young mice overexpressing the Sod2 (MnSOD) gene, old (28 months) wild-type, and old transgenic mice. Left ventricle MnSOD protein levels were elevated in young mice overexpressing the Sod2 (MnSOD) gene and old transgenic mice. MnSODTg mice exhibited lower oxidative stress (total hydroperoxides, 4-hydroxynonenal, and 8-isoprostane) in the old group. Age-related cardiac remodeling and fibrosis was mitigated in MnSOD Tg mice with reductions in extramyocyte space (−65%), collagen-I, and transforming growth factor-β. Pro-apoptotic markers Bax (−38%) and caspase-3 cleavage (−41%) were reduced and apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive nuclei, DNA laddering) was mitigated in MnSOD Tg hearts compared with old wild-type.

Lifelong wheel running exercise and mild caloric restriction attenuate nuclear EndoG in the aging plantaris muscle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5026643/,"Apoptosis plays an important role in atrophy and sarcopenia in skeletal muscle. Recent evidence suggests that insufficient heat shock proteins (HSPs) may contribute to apoptosis and muscle wasting. In addition, long-term caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong wheel running exercise (WR) with CR provide significant protection against caspase-dependent apoptosis and sarcopenia. Caspase-independent mediators (endonuclease G: EndoG; apoptosis-inducing factor: AIF) of apoptosis are also linked to muscles wasting with disuse and aging. However, the efficacy of CR and WR with CR to attenuate caspase-independent apoptosis and preserve HSPs in aging skeletal muscle are unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that CR and WR with CR would ameliorate age-induced elevation of EndoG and AIF while protecting HSP27 and HSP70 levels in the plantaris. Male Fischer-344 rats were divided into 4 groups at 11 weeks: ad libitum feeding until 6 mo. (YAL); fed ad libitum until 24 mo. old (OAL); 8%CR to 24 mo. (OCR); WR + 8%CR to 24 mo. (OExCR). Nuclear EndoG levels were significantly higher in OAL (+153%) than in YAL, while CR (−38%) and WR with CR (−46%) significantly attenuated age-induced increment in nuclear EndoG. HSP27 (−63%) protein content and phosphorylation at Ser82 (−49%) were significantly lower in OAL than in YAL, while HSP27 protein content was significantly higher in OCR (+136%) and OExCR (+155%) and p-HSP27 (+254%) was significantly higher in OExCR compared with OAL, respectively. In contrast, AIF and HSP70 were unaltered by CR or WR with CR in aging muscle.

Age-related alterations in the sarcolemmal environment are attenuated by lifelong caloric restriction and voluntary exercise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5026642/,"Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, referred to as sarcopenia, is mitigated by lifelong calorie restriction as well as exercise. In aged skeletal muscle fibers there is compromised integrity of the cell membrane that may contribute to sarcopenia. The purpose of this study was to determine if lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong CR + voluntary wheel running (WR) could ameliorate disruption of membrane scaffolding and signaling proteins during the aging process, thus maintaining a favorable, healthy membrane environment in plantaris muscle fibers. Fischer-344 rats were divided into four groups: 24-month old adults fed ad libitum (OAL); 24-month old on 8% caloric restriction (OCR); 24 month old 8% caloric restriction + wheel running (OCRWR); 6-month old sedentary adults fed ad libitum (YAL) were used to determine age-related changes. Aging resulted in discontinuous membrane expression of dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins: dystrophin and α-syntrophin. Older muscle also displayed decreased content of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a key DGC signaling protein. In contrast, OCR and OCRWR provided significant protection against age-related DGC disruption. In conjunction with the age-related decline in membrane DGC patency, key membrane repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2) were significantly increased in the OAL plantaris. However, lifelong CR and CRWR interventions were effective at maintaining membrane repair proteins near YAL levels of. OAL fibers also displayed reduced protein content of NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) subunits (p67phox and p47phox), consistent with a perturbed sarcolemmal environment.

The elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria and Nox2, coupled with impairment of stress protection (e.g., SIRT1, antioxidant enzymes), contribute to atrophy. We tested the hypothesis that the SIRT1 activator, SRT2104 would rescue unloading-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial function in rat gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were evaluated under three conditions (10 days): ambulatory control (CON), hindlimb unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded-treated with SRT2104 (SIRT). Oxidative phosphorylation, electron transfer capacities, H 2 O 2 production, and oxidative and antioxidant enzymes were quantified using high-resolution respirometry and colorimetry. In the gastrocnemius, (1) integrative (per mg tissue) proton LEAK was lesser in SIRT than in HU or CON; (2) intrinsic (relative to citrate synthase) maximal noncoupled electron transfer capacity (E CI+II ) was lesser, while complex I-supported oxidative phosphorylation to E CI+II was greater in HU than CON; (3) the contribution of LEAK to E CI+II was greatest, but cytochrome c oxidase activity was lowest in HU. In both muscles, H 2 O 2 production and concentration was greatest in SIRT, as was gastrocnemius superoxide dismutase activity. In the soleus, H 2 O 2 concentration was greater in HU compared to CON.

Bioreactor development for skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy by manipulating uniaxial cyclic strain: Proof of concept.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11167039/,"Skeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing tensile forces that produce movement through joint rotation. Conversely, the microgravity of spaceflight reduces tensile loads in working skeletal muscles, causing an adaptive muscle atrophy.

Here, we tested a bioreactor that uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively, in murine lineage (C2C12) skeletal muscle myotubes. Uniaxial cyclic stretch of myotubes was conducted using a StrexCell® (STB-1400) stepper motor system (0.75 Hz, 12% strain, 60 min day^-1). Myotube groups were assigned as follows: (a) quiescent over 2- or (b) 5-day (no stretch), (c) experienced 2-days (2dHY) or (d) 5-days (5dHY) of cyclic stretch, or (e) 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). Using ß-sarcoglycan as a sarcolemmal marker, mean myotube diameter increased significantly following 2dAT (51%) and 5dAT (94%) vs. matched controls. The hypertrophic, anabolic markers talin and Akt phosphorylation (Thr308) were elevated with 2dHY but not in 3dAT myotubes. Inflammatory, catabolic markers IL-1ß, IL6, and NF-kappaB p65 subunit were significantly higher in the 3dAT group vs. all other groups. The ratio of phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a was significantly lower in 3dAT than in the 2dHY group, consistent with elevated catabolic signaling during unloading. In summary, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for a spaceflight research bioreactor, using uniaxial cyclic stretch to produce myotube hypertrophy with increased tensile loading, and myotube atrophy with subsequent cessation of stretch.

Genomic and phenotypic characterization of Burkholderia isolates from the potable water system of the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10020673/,"Urine, humidity condensate, and other sources of non-potable water are processed onboard the International Space Station (ISS) by the Water Recovery System (WRS) yielding potable water. While some means of microbial control are in place, including a phosphoric acid/hexavalent chromium urine pretreatment solution, many areas within the WRS are not available for routine microbial monitoring. Due to refurbishment needs, two flex lines from the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) within the WRS were removed and returned to Earth. The water from within these lines, as well as flush water, was microbially evaluated. Culture and culture-independent analysis revealed the presence of Burkholderia , Paraburkholderia , and Leifsonia . Fungal culture also identified Fusarium and Lecythophora . Hybrid de novo genome analysis of the five distinct Burkholderia isolates identified them as B. contaminans, while the two Paraburkholderia isolates were identified as P. fungorum . Chromate-resistance gene clusters were identified through pangenomic analysis that differentiated these genomes from previously studied isolates recovered from the point-of-use potable water dispenser and/or current NCBI references, indicating that unique populations exist within distinct niches in the WRS. Beyond genomic analysis, fixed samples directly from the lines were imaged by environmental scanning electron microscopy, which detailed networks of fungal-bacterial biofilms. This is the first evidence of biofilm formation within flex lines from the UPA onboard the ISS. For all bacteria isolated, biofilm potential was further characterized, with the B. contaminans isolates demonstrating the most considerable biofilm formation. Moreover, the genomes of the B. contaminans revealed secondary metabolite gene clusters associated with quorum sensing, biofilm formation, antifungal compounds, and hemolysins. The potential production of these gene cluster metabolites was phenotypically evaluated through biofilm, bacterial-fungal interaction, and hemolytic assays. Collectively, these data identify the UPA flex lines as a unique ecological niche and novel area of biofilm growth within the WRS. Further investigation of these organisms and their resistance profiles will enable engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention in future space station water systems.

CAMDLES: CFD-DEM Simulation of Microbial Communities in Spaceflight and Artificial Microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9144607/,"We present CAMDLES (CFD-DEM Artificial Microgravity Developments for Living Ecosystem Simulation), an extension of CFDEM ® Coupling to model biological flows, growth, and mass transfer in artificial microgravity devices. For microbes that accompany humans into space, microgravity-induced alterations in the fluid environment are likely to be a major factor in the microbial experience of spaceflight. Computational modeling is needed to investigate how well ground-based microgravity simulation methods replicate that experience. CAMDLES incorporates agent-based modeling to study inter-species metabolite transport within microbial communities in rotating wall vessel bioreactors (RWVs). Preexisting CFD modeling of RWVs has not yet incorporated growth; CAMDLES employs the simultaneous modeling of biological, chemical, and mechanical processes in a micro-scale rotating reference frame environment. Simulation mass transfer calculations were correlated with Monod dynamic parameters to predict relative growth rates between artificial microgravity, spaceflight microgravity, and 1 g conditions. By simulating a microbial model community of metabolically cooperative strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, we found that the greatest difference between microgravity and an RWV or 1 g gravity was when species colocalized in dense aggregates. We also investigated the influence of other features of the system on growth, such as spatial distribution, product yields, and diffusivity. Our simulation provides a basis for future laboratory experiments using this community for investigation in artificial microgravity and spaceflight microgravity. More broadly, our development of these models creates a framework for novel hypothesis generation and design of biological experiments with RWVs, coupling the effects of RWV size, rotation rate, and mass transport directly to bacterial growth in microbial communities.

Hardware validation of the Advanced Plant Habitat on ISS: Canopy photosynthesis in reduced gravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314936/,"The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) is the largest research plant growth facility deployed on the International Space Station (ISS). APH is a fully enclosed, closed-loop plant life support system with an environmentally controlled growth chamber designed for conducting both fundamental and applied plant research during experiments extending as long as 135 days. APH was delivered to the ISS in parts aboard two commercial resupply missions: OA-7 in April 2017 and SpaceX-11 in June 2017, and was assembled and installed in the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo in November 2018. We report here on a 7-week-long hardware validation test that utilized a root module planted with both Arabidopsis (cv. Col 0) and wheat (cv. Apogee) plants. The validation test examined the APH’s ability to control light intensity, spectral quality, humidity, CO 2 concentration, photoperiod, temperature, and root zone moisture using commanding from ground facilities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The test also demonstrated the execution of programmed experiment profiles that scheduled: (1) changes in environmental combinations (e.g., a daily photoperiod at constant relative humidity), (2) predetermined photographic events using the three APH cameras [overhead, sideview, and sideview near-infrared (NIR)], and (3) execution of experimental sequences during the life cycle of a crop (e.g., measure photosynthetic CO 2 drawdown experiments). Arabidopsis and wheat were grown in microgravity to demonstrate crew procedures, planting protocols and watering schemes within APH. The ability of APH to contain plant debris was assessed during the harvest of mature Arabidopsis plants. Wheat provided a large evaporative load that tested root zone moisture control and the recovery of transpired water by condensation. The wheat canopy was also used to validate the ability of APH to measure gas exchange of plants from non-invasive gas exchange measurements (i.e., canopy photosynthesis and respiration). These features were evaluated by executing experiment profiles that utilized the CO 2 drawdown technique to measure daily rates of canopy photosynthesis and dark-period CO 2 increase for respiration. This hardware validation test confirmed that APH can measure fundamental plant responses to spaceflight conditions.

New insights into lignification via network and multi-omics analyses of arogenate dehydratase knock-out mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8185232/,"Multiple Arabidopsis arogenate dehydratase ( ADT ) knock-out (KO) mutants, with phenotypes having variable lignin levels (up to circa 70% reduction), were studied to investigate how differential reductions in ADTs perturb its overall plant systems biology. Integrated “omics” analyses (metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome) of wild type (WT), single and multiple ADT KO lines were conducted. Transcriptome and proteome data were collapsed into gene ortholog (GO) data, with this allowing for enzymatic reaction and metabolome cross-comparisons to uncover dominant or likely metabolic biosynthesis reactions affected. Network analysis of enzymes–highly correlated to stem lignin levels–deduced the involvement of novel putative lignin related proteins or processes. These included those associated with ribosomes, the spliceosome, mRNA transport, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, and phosphorylation. While prior work helped explain lignin biosynthesis regulation at the transcriptional level, our data here provide support for a new hypothesis that there are additional post-transcriptional and translational level processes that need to be considered. These findings are anticipated to lead to development of more accurate depictions of lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis models in situ , with new protein targets identified for further biochemical analysis and/or plant bioengineering. Additionally, using KEGG defined functional categorization of proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we detected significant changes to glucosinolate, α-linolenic acid, nitrogen, carotenoid, aromatic amino acid, phenylpropanoid, and photosynthesis-related metabolic pathways in ADT KO mutants. Metabolomics results also revealed that putative carotenoid and galactolipid levels were generally increased in amount, whereas many glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids (including flavonoids and lignans) were decreased in the KO mutants.

Functional consequences of radiation-induced oxidative stress in cultured neural stem cells and the brain exposed to charged particle irradiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3936501/,"Aims: Redox homeostasis is critical in regulating the fate and function of multipotent cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we investigated whether low dose charged particle irradiation could elicit oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells and whether radiation-induced changes in redox metabolism would coincide with cognitive impairment. Results: Low doses (<1 Gy) of charged particles caused an acute and persistent oxidative stress. Early after (<1 week) irradiation, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were generally dose responsive, but were less dependent on dose weeks to months thereafter. Exposure to ion fluences resulting in less than one ion traversal per cell was sufficient to elicit radiation-induced oxidative stress. Whole body irradiation triggered a compensatory response in the rodent brain that led to a significant increase in antioxidant capacity 2 weeks following exposure, before returning to background levels at week 4. Low dose irradiation was also found to significantly impair novel object recognition in mice 2 and 12 weeks following irradiation. Innovation: Data provide evidence that acute exposure of neural stem cells and the CNS to very low doses and fluences of charged particles can elicit a persisting oxidative stress lasting weeks to months that is associated with impaired cognition. Conclusions: Exposure to low doses of charged particles causes a persistent oxidative stress and cognitive impairment over protracted times.

Exploration of space to achieve scientific breakthroughs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11998595/,"Beta cell replacement therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by advances in stem cell biology, gene editing, and tissue engineering. While islet transplantation has demonstrated proof-of-concept success in restoring endogenous insulin production, its clinical impact remains limited by donor scarcity, immune rejection, and procedural complexities. The emergence of stem cell-derived beta-like cells represents a paradigm shift, with initial clinical trials showing promising insulin secretion in vivo . However, translating these breakthroughs into scalable, widely accessible treatments poses significant challenges. Drawing parallels to space exploration, this paper argues that while scientific feasibility has been demonstrated, true accessibility remains elusive. Without a strategic shift, beta cell therapy risks becoming an elite intervention, restricted by cost and infrastructure. Lessons from gene and cell therapies for rare diseases highlight the dangers of unsustainable pricing and limited market viability. To bridge the “last mile” a Quality by Design approach is proposed, emphasizing scalability, ease of use, and economic feasibility from the outset.

Network Analysis of Gene Transcriptions of Arabidopsis thaliana in Spaceflight Microgravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7996555/,"The transcriptomic datasets of the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana grown in the International Space Station provided by GeneLab have been mined to isolate the impact of spaceflight microgravity on gene expressions related to root growth. A set of computational tools is used to identify the hub genes that respond differently in spaceflight with controlled lighting compared to on the ground. These computational tools based on graph-theoretic approaches are used to infer gene regulatory networks from the transcriptomic datasets. The three main algorithms used for network analyses are Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Pearson correlation, and the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm. Graph-based spectral analyses reveal distinct properties of the spaceflight microgravity networks for the Wassilewskija (WS), Columbia (Col)-0, and mutant phytochromeD ( phyD ) ecotypes. The set of hub genes that are significantly altered in spaceflight microgravity are mainly involved in cell wall synthesis, protein transport, response to auxin, stress responses, and catabolic processes. Network analysis highlights five important root growth-regulating hub genes that have the highest outdegree distribution in spaceflight microgravity networks. These concerned genes coding for proteins are identified from the Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) corresponding to spaceflight total light environment.

Pearson correlation-based gene regulatory network inferencing from transcriptional responses of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana L. grown in real and simulated spaceflight conditions acquired by GeneLab, followed by topological and spectral analysis of the networks is performed. Gene regulatory subnetworks are extracted for DNA damage response processes. Analysis of radiation-induced ATR/ATM protein–protein interactions in Arabidopsis reveals interaction profile similarities under low radiation doses suggesting novel mechanisms of DNA damage response involving non-radiation-induced genes regulating other stress responses in spaceflight. The Jaccard similarity index shows that the genes AT2G31320, AT4G21070, AT2G46610, and AT3G27060 perform similar functions under low doses of radiation. The incremental association Markov blanket method reveals non-radiation-induced genes linking DNA damage response to root growth and plant development.

"The Effect of spaceflight on mouse olfactory bulb volume, neurogenesis, and cell death indicates the protective effect of novel environment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4152162/,"Space missions necessitate physiological and psychological adaptations to environmental factors not present on Earth, some of which present significant risks for the central nervous system (CNS) of crewmembers. One CNS region of interest is the adult olfactory bulb (OB), as OB structure and function are sensitive to environmental- and experience-induced regulation. It is currently unknown how the OB is altered by spaceflight. In this study, we evaluated OB volume and neurogenesis in mice shortly after a 13-day flight on Space Shuttle Atlantis [Space Transport System (STS)-135] relative to two groups of control mice maintained on Earth. Mice housed on Earth in animal enclosure modules that mimicked the conditions onboard STS-135 (AEM-Ground mice) had greater OB volume relative to mice maintained in standard housing on Earth (Vivarium mice), particularly in the granule (GCL) and glomerular (GL) cell layers. AEM-Ground mice also had more OB neuroblasts and fewer apoptotic cells relative to Vivarium mice. However, the AEM-induced increase in OB volume and neurogenesis was not seen in STS-135 mice (AEM-Flight mice), suggesting that spaceflight may have negated the positive effects of the AEM. In fact, when OB volume of AEM-Flight mice was considered, there was a greater density of apoptotic cells relative to AEM-Ground mice. Our findings suggest that factors present during spaceflight have opposing effects on OB size and neurogenesis, and provide insight into potential strategies to preserve OB structure and function during future space missions.

We used a mouse model to determine short- and long-term cardiac effects to simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading; HU), continuous low-dose rate γ-irradiation, or a combination of HU and low-dose rate γ-irradiation. Methods Cardiac tissue was obtained from female, C57BL/6J mice 7 days, 1 month, 4 months, and 9 months following the completion of a 21 day exposure to HU or a 21 day exposure to low-dose rate γ-irradiation (average dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h to a total of 0.04 Gy), or a 21 day simultaneous exposure to HU and low-dose rate γ-irradiation. Immunoblot analysis, rt-PCR, high-performance liquid chromatography, and histology were used to assess inflammatory cell infiltration, cardiac remodeling, oxidative stress, and the methylation potential of cardiac tissue in 3 to 6 animals per group. Results The combination of HU and γ-irradiation demonstrated the strongest increase in reduced to oxidized glutathione ratios 7 days and 1 month after treatment, but a difference was no longer apparent after 9 months. On the other hand, no significant changes in 4-hydroxynonenal adducts was seen in any of the groups, at the measured endpoints. While manganese superoxide dismutase protein levels decreased 9 months after low-dose γ-radiation, no changes were observed in expression of catalase or Nrf2, a transcription factor that determines the expression of several antioxidant enzymes, at the measured endpoints. Inflammatory marker, CD-2 protein content was significantly decreased in all groups 4 months after treatment. No significant differences were observed in α-smooth muscle cell actin protein content, collagen type III protein content or % total collagen. Conclusions This study has provided the first and relatively broad analysis of small molecule and protein markers of oxidative stress, T-lymphocyte infiltration, and cardiac remodeling in response to HU with simultaneous exposure to low-dose rate γ-radiation. Results from the late observation time points suggest that the hearts had mostly recovered from these two experimental conditions.

Characterization of mouse ocular response to a 35-day spaceflight mission: Evidence of blood-retinal barrier disruption and ocular adaptations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6547757/,"The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p < 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.

Mice Exposed to Combined Chronic Low-Dose Irradiation and Modeled Microgravity Develop Long-Term Neurological Sequelae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6747492/,"Spaceflight poses many challenges for humans. Ground-based analogs typically focus on single parameters of spaceflight and their associated acute effects. This study assesses the long-term transcriptional effects following single and combination spaceflight analog conditions using the mouse model: simulated microgravity via hindlimb unloading (HLU) and/or low-dose γ-ray irradiation (LDR) for 21 days, followed by 4 months of readaptation. Changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifications in brain samples during readaptation were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). The results showed minimal gene expression and cytosine methylation alterations at 4 months readaptation within single treatment conditions of HLU or LDR. In contrast, following combined HLU+LDR, gene expression and promoter methylation analyses showed multiple altered pathways involved in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, the regulation of neuropeptides, and cellular signaling. In brief, neurological readaptation following combined chronic LDR and HLU is a dynamic process that involves pathways that regulate neuronal function and structure and may lead to late onset neurological sequelae.

"Spaceflight influences gene expression, photoreceptor integrity, and oxidative stress-related damage in the murine retina.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6746706/,"Extended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/−4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment.

Evaluating ocular response in the retina and optic nerve head after single and fractionated high-energy protons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8400407/,"There are serious concerns about possible late radiation damage to ocular tissue from prolonged space radiation exposure, and occupational and medical procedures. This study aimed to investigate the effects of whole-body high-energy proton exposure at a single dose on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by fractionated dose. Six-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were either sham irradiated or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at an acute single dose of 0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractions for a total dose of 0.5 Gy over twenty-five days. At four months following irradiation, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for histochemical analysis. Significant increases in the number of apoptotic cells were documented in the mouse retinas and ONHs that received proton radiation with a single or fractionated dose ( p < 0.05). Immunochemical analysis revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for oxidative biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the retina and ONH following single or fractionated protons with more pronounced changes observed with a single dose of 0.5 Gy. BRB integrity was also evaluated with biomarkers of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), a water channel protein, a tight junction (TJ) protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and an adhesion molecule, the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). A significantly increased expression of AQP-4 was observed in the retina following a single dose exposure compared to controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and a decrease in the expression of ZO-1 in the retina. These changes give a strong indication of disturbance to BRB integrity in the retina. Interestingly, there was very limited immunoreactivity of AQP-4 and ZO-1 seen in the ONH region, pointing to possible lack of BRB properties as previously reported. Our data demonstrated that exposure to proton radiation of 0.5 Gy induced oxidative stress-associated apoptosis in the retina and ONH, and changes in BRB integrity in the retina. Our study also revealed the differences in BRB biomarker distribution between these two regions. In response to radiation insults, the cellular response in the retina and ONH may be differentially regulated in acute or hyperfractionated dose schedules.

Characterization of gene expression profiles in the mouse brain after 35 days of spaceflight mission.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9365836/,"It has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoString TM ) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes ( p < 0.05) significantly segregates the habitat ground control (GC) group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. Here we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on the neuronal function.

Evidence of spaceflight-induced adverse effects on photoreceptors and retinal function in the mouse eye.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10138634/,"The goal of the present study was to characterize acute oxidative damage in ocular structure and retinal function after exposure to spaceflight, and to evaluate the efficacy of an antioxidant in reducing spaceflight-induced changes in the retina. Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS on Space-X 24 over 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. The mice received a weekly injection of a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), before launch and during their stay onboard the ISS. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Before the launch, intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a handheld tonometer and retinal function was evaluated using electroretinogram (ERG). ERG signals were recorded when the mouse eye was under dark-adapted conditions in response to ultraviolet monochromatic light flashes. Within 20 h after splashdown, IOP and ERG assessments were repeated before euthanasia. There were significant increases in body weight for habitat control groups post-flight compared to pre-flight measurements. However, the body weights were similar among flight groups before launch and after splashdown. The IOP measurements were similar between pre- and post-flight groups with no significant differences between BuOE-treated and saline controls. Immunofluorescence evaluation showed increases in retinal oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death after spaceflight. BuOE treatment significantly decreased the level of the oxidative stress biomarker. ERG data showed that the average amplitudes of the a- and b-wave were significantly decreased (39% and 32% by spaceflight, respectively) compared to that of habitat ground controls.

Effects of spaceflight on the brain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12031868/,"Under conditions of weightlessness human position sense appears to deteriorate. This was tested, employing three methods of measurement: two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning, carried out during parabolic flight. In hypergravity (1.8G), position sense errors in a matching task increased significantly from the value during horizontal flight (1G) of + 2.5° (± 3.8° SD), to + 3.5° (± 3.3°). For pointing, errors increased significantly from + 9.1° (± 4.4°) to + 11.2° (± 4.4°). In microgravity (0G), matching errors fell significantly to + 0.35° (± 3.5°), while in pointing the fall was not significant. For repositioning, there were no significant changes in errors in either hypergravity or microgravity. It is proposed that the errors in matching and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint to alter the position signal coming from muscle and joint receptors. For repositioning, memory of the test angle was stored centrally, to be reproduced independently of any changes in gravity.

Genomic characterization and radiation tolerance of Naganishia kalamii sp. nov. and Cystobasidium onofrii sp. nov. from Mars 2020 mission assembly facilities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10422843/,"During the construction and assembly of the Mars 2020 mission components at two different NASA cleanrooms, several fungal strains were isolated. Based on their colony morphology, two strains that showed yeast-like appearance were further characterized for their phylogenetic position. The species-level classification of these two novel strains, using traditional colony and cell morphology methods combined with the phylogenetic reconstructions using multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on several gene loci (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB 1, RPB2 , CYTB and TEF1 ), and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out. This polyphasic taxonomic approach supported the conclusion that the two basidiomycetous yeasts belong to hitherto undescribed species. The strain FJI-L2-BK-P3 T , isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility, was placed in the Naganishia albida clade (Filobasidiales, Tremellomycetes), but is genetically and physiologically different from other members of the clade. Another yeast strain FKI-L6-BK-PAB1 T , isolated from the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazardous and Servicing Facility, was placed in the genus Cystobasidium ( Cystobasidiales, Cystobasidiomycetes ) and is distantly related to C. benthicum. Here we propose two novel species with the type strains, Naganishia kalamii sp. nov. (FJI-L2-BK-P3 T = NRRL 64466 = DSM 115730) and Cystobasidium onofrii sp. nov. (FKI-L6-BK-PAB1 T = NRRL 64426 = DSM 114625). The phylogenetic analyses revealed that single gene phylogenies (ITS or LSU) were not conclusive, and MLSA and WGS-based phylogenies were more advantageous for species discrimination in the two genera. The genomic analysis predicted proteins associated with dehydration and desiccation stress-response and the presence of genes that are directly related to osmotolerance and psychrotolerance in both novel yeasts described. Cells of these two newly-described yeasts were exposed to UV-C radiation and compared with N. onofrii, an extremophilic UV-C resistant cold-adapted Alpine yeast.

"Genome and clonal hematopoiesis stability contrasts with immune, cfDNA, mitochondrial, and telomere length changes during short duration spaceflight",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11022651/,"Background The Inspiration4 (I4) mission, the first all-civilian orbital flight mission, investigated the physiological effects of short-duration spaceflight through a multi-omic approach. Despite advances, there remains much to learn about human adaptation to spaceflight's unique challenges, including microgravity, immune system perturbations, and radiation exposure. Methods To provide a detailed genetics analysis of the mission, we collected dried blood spots pre-, during, and post-flight for DNA extraction. Telomere length was measured by quantitative PCR, while whole genome and cfDNA sequencing provided insight into genomic stability and immune adaptations. A robust bioinformatic pipeline was used for data analysis, including variant calling to assess mutational burden. Result Telomere elongation occurred during spaceflight and shortened after return to Earth. Cell-free DNA analysis revealed increased immune cell signatures post-flight. No significant clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) or whole-genome instability was observed. The long-term gene expression changes across immune cells suggested cellular adaptations to the space environment persisting months post-flight. Conclusion Our findings provide valuable insights into the physiological consequences of short-duration spaceflight, with telomere dynamics and immune cell gene expression adapting to spaceflight and persisting after return to Earth. CHIP sequencing data will serve as a reference point for studying the early development of CHIP in astronauts, an understudied phenomenon as previous studies have focused on career astronauts.

Telomeric RNA (TERRA) increases in response to spaceflight and high-altitude climbing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11167063/,"Telomeres are repetitive nucleoprotein complexes at chromosomal termini essential for maintaining genome stability. Telomeric RNA, or TERRA, is a previously presumed long noncoding RNA of heterogeneous lengths that contributes to end-capping structure and function, and facilitates telomeric recombination in tumors that maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we investigated TERRA in the radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) across astronauts, high-altitude climbers, healthy donors, and cellular models. Similar to astronauts in the space radiation environment and climbers of Mt. Everest, in vitro radiation exposure prompted increased transcription of TERRA, while simulated microgravity did not. Data suggest a specific TERRA DDR to telomeric double-strand breaks (DSBs), and provide direct demonstration of hybridized TERRA at telomere-specific DSB sites, indicative of protective TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid formation. Targeted telomeric DSBs also resulted in accumulation of TERRA foci in G2-phase, supportive of TERRA’s role in facilitating recombination-mediated telomere elongation. Results have important implications for scenarios involving persistent telomeric DNA damage, such as those associated with chronic oxidative stress (e.g., aging, systemic inflammation, environmental and occupational radiation exposures), which can trigger transient ALT in normal human cells, as well as for targeting TERRA as a therapeutic strategy against ALT-positive tumors.

Spatial multi-omics of human skin reveals KRAS and inflammatory responses to spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166909/,"Spaceflight can change metabolic, immunological, and biological homeostasis and cause skin rashes and irritation, yet the molecular basis remains unclear. To investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on the skin, we conducted skin biopsies on the Inspiration4 crew members before (L-44) and after (R + 1) flight. Leveraging multi-omics assays including GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler, single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, we assessed spatial gene expressions and associated microbial and immune changes across 95 skin regions in four compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and vasculature.

Longitudinal multi-omics analysis of host microbiome architecture and immune responses during short-term spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11222149/,"Maintenance of astronaut health during spaceflight will require monitoring and potentially modulating their microbiomes. However, documenting microbial shifts during spaceflight has been difficult due to mission constraints that lead to limited sampling and profiling. Here we executed a six-month longitudinal study to quantify the high-resolution human microbiome response to three days in orbit for four individuals. Using paired metagenomics and metatranscriptomics alongside single-nuclei immune cell profiling, we characterized time-dependent, multikingdom microbiome changes across 750 samples and 10 body sites before, during and after spaceflight at eight timepoints. We found that most alterations were transient across body sites; for example, viruses increased in skin sites mostly during flight. However, longer-term shifts were observed in the oral microbiome, including increased plaque-associated bacteria (for example, Fusobacteriota ), which correlated with immune cell gene expression. Further, microbial genes associated with phage activity, toxin–antitoxin systems and stress response were enriched across multiple body sites. In total, this study reveals in-depth characterization of microbiome and immune response shifts experienced by astronauts during short-term spaceflight and the associated changes to the living environment, which can help guide future missions, spacecraft design and space habitat planning.

Haemoglobin biology provides an intriguing model for studying space omics, as it has been extensively explored at multiple -omic levels, spanning DNA, RNA, and protein analyses, in both experimental and clinical contexts. In this study, we examined the developmental expression of haemoglobin over time and space using a unique suite of multi-omic datasets available on NASA GeneLab, from the NASA Twins Study, the JAXA CFE study, and the Inspiration4 mission.

Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single-cell analysis by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity alters specific pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inflammation (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and sirtuin signaling. Microgravity directs monocyte inflammatory parameters, and impairs T cell and NK cell functionality.

"Secretome profiling reveals acute changes in oxidative stress, brain homeostasis, and coagulation following short-duration spaceflight",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166969/,"As spaceflight becomes more common with commercial crews, blood-based measures of crew health can guide both astronaut biomedicine and countermeasures. By profiling plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles/particles (EVPs) from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, we generated “spaceflight secretome profiles,” which showed significant differences in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins. While >93% of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in vesicles and metabolites recovered within six months, the majority (73%) of plasma DAPs were still perturbed post-flight. Moreover, these proteomic alterations correlated better with peripheral blood mononuclear cells than whole blood, suggesting that immune cells contribute more DAPs than erythrocytes. Finally, to discern possible mechanisms leading to brain-enriched protein detection and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, we examined protein changes in dissected brains of spaceflight mice, which showed increases in PECAM-1, a marker of BBB integrity. These data highlight how even short-duration spaceflight can disrupt human and murine physiology and identify spaceflight biomarkers that can guide countermeasure development.

The biology driving the frequency of skin issues in astronauts is currently not well understood. Methods To address this issue, we used a systems biology approach utilizing NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) on space flown murine transcriptomic datasets focused on the skin, biochemical profiles of 50 NASA astronauts and human transcriptomic datasets generated from blood and hair samples of JAXA astronauts, as well as blood samples obtained from the NASA Twins Study, and skin and blood samples from the first civilian commercial mission, Inspiration4. Results Key biological changes related to skin health, DNA damage & repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation are identified as potential drivers for skin health risks during spaceflight. Additionally, a machine learning model is utilized to determine gene pairings associated with spaceflight response in the skin. While we identified spaceflight-induced dysregulation, such as alterations in genes associated with skin barrier function and collagen formation, our results also highlight the remarkable ability for organisms to re-adapt back to Earth via post-flight re-tuning of gene expression.

Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways.

Growth chambers on the International Space Station for large plants,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10780891/,"Planning long-term space flights necessarily includes issues of providing food for the crew. One of the areas of research is the development of technologies for independent production of food by the crew. Extensive research on lettuce has confirmed that the “space production” of lettuce is not inferior to that on Earth, even in the absence of gravity, but the same deep understanding of the quality of grain crops has not yet been achieved. Therefore, the goal of our work is to establish whether the conditions for growing wheat in outer space without gravity affect the weight and basic parameters of the grain, and whether this leads to increased asymmetry of the kernel and distortion of the starch composition. The objects of the study were wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) kernels of the Super Dwarf cultivar. Of which, 100 kernels matured in outer space conditions in the Lada growth chamber on the International Space Station (ISS), and 85 kernels of the control wheat grown in a similar growth chamber under terrestrial conditions. It has been established that kernels from ISS have significant differences to a smaller extent in weight, area, length, and width of the kernel. However, the kernels under both conditions were predominantly large (the average weight of a kernel in space is 0.0362 g, and in terrestrial conditions—0.0376 g). The hypothesis that the level of fluctuating asymmetry will increase in outer space was not confirmed; significant differences between the options were not proven. In general, the kernels are fairly even (coefficients of variation for the main parameters of the kernel are within 6–12%) and with a low or very low level of asymmetry. The length of starch granules of type A in filled and puny kernels is significantly greater in kernels from ISS than in the control, and in terms of the width of starch granules B and roundness indices, both experimental variants are the same. It can be assumed that the baking qualities of earthly kernels will be slightly higher, since the ratio of type B starch granules to type A is 5–8% higher than on the ISS. Also, the width of the aleurone layer cells in mature kernels was significantly inferior to the result obtained on Earth. The work proposes a new method for establishing the asymmetry of kernels without a traumatic effect (in early works, it was supposed to study asymmetry in transverse sections of the kernels). Perhaps this will make it possible to further develop a computer scanning program that will determine the level of asymmetry of the wheat fruit.

Microbiological and nutritional analysis of lettuce crops grown on the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7067979/,"The ability to grow safe, fresh food to supplement packaged foods of astronauts in space has been an important goal for NASA. Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log 10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels.

Auxin: Shape matters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6710492/,"We evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50®, a commercial formulation of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), on the structure of both micro + nano phytoplankton (>2 μm; species composition and abundance) and cytometric populations (photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP, 0.2–2 μm), which included prokaryotic phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk); and bacterioplankton (HB), heterotrophic bacteria), using a microcosms-based approach and a single 7-day exposure. Assays were performed on two different microbial assemblages sampled from freshwater bodies of two contrasting turbidity status: clear (chlorophyll a = 7.6 μgL -1 , turbidity = 1 NTU) and organic turbid systems (chlorophyll a = 25.0 μgL -1 , turbidity = 9 NTU). For each system, the herbicide was applied to 500 mL-Erlenmeyer flasks, at seven concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control = no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg a.i.L −1 . The impact of AsiMax 50® seemed to be greater in the turbid system. In this system, total abundance of living (live) micro + nano phytoplankton showed a significant increase at lower concentrations and data were fitted to a humped-shaped curve. For both clear and organic turbid systems, micro + nano phytoplankton decreased in species richness and abundance at higher herbicide concentrations. These results suggest that 2,4-D may mimic hormonal function. Some species, such as Ochromonas sp. and Chlamydomonas sp., showed different responses to herbicide exposure between water systems. In the turbid system, the increase in abundance of the PPP fraction observed at 7-d exposure was probably due to either an increase in PE-Pcy (thus suggesting the existence of auxin pathways) or a reduction in competitive pressure by micro + nano plankton. Our results provide some evidence of the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to a 2,4-D-based formulation. However, caution must be taken when extrapolating these effects to real scenarios, as assays were based on a laboratory microcosm experiment.

Cadaverine regulates biotin synthesis to modulate primary root growth in Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8518694/,"SUMMARY Cadaverine, a polyamine, has been linked to modification of root growth architecture and response to environmental stresses in plants. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of root growth by cadaverine are largely unexplored. Here we conducted a forward genetic screen and isolated a mutation, cadaverine hypersensitive 3 ( cdh3 ), which resulted in increased root‐growth sensitivity to cadaverine, but not other polyamines. This mutation affects the BIO3‐BIO1 biotin biosynthesis gene. Exogenous supply of biotin and a pathway intermediate downstream of BIO1, 7,8‐diaminopelargonic acid, suppressed this cadaverine sensitivity phenotype. An in vitro enzyme assay showed cadaverine inhibits the BIO3‐BIO1 activity. Furthermore, cadaverine‐treated seedlings displayed reduced biotinylation of Biotin Carboxyl Carrier Protein 1 of the acetyl‐coenzyme A carboxylase complex involved in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, resulting in decreased accumulation of triacylglycerides. Taken together, these results revealed an unexpected role of cadaverine in the regulation of biotin biosynthesis, which leads to modulation of primary root growth of plants.

In this project, we have investigated the root curvature response to low-speed clinorotation using Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon seedlings as models. We show that low-speed clinorotation triggers root tip curvature in which direction is dictated by gravitropism during the first half-turn of clinorotation. We also show that the angle of root tip curvature is modulated by the speed of clinorotation. Arabidopsis mutations affecting gravity susception ( pgm ) or gravity signal transduction ( arg1 , toc132 ) are shown to affect the root tip curvature response to low-speed clinorotation. Furthermore, low-speed vertical clinorotation triggers relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator to the lateral membrane of Arabidopsis root cap statocytes, and creates a lateral gradient of auxin across the root tip. Together, these observations support a role for gravitropism in modulating root curvature responses to clinorotation. Interestingly, distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions display different abilities to develop root tip curvature responses to low-speed vertical clinorotation, suggesting the possibility of using genome-wide association studies to further investigate this process.

New device for high-throughput viability screening of flow biofilms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897429/,"Control of biofilms requires rapid methods to identify compounds effective against them and to isolate resistance-compromised mutants for identifying genes involved in enhanced biofilm resistance. While rapid screening methods for microtiter plate well (“static”) biofilms are available, there are no methods for such screening of continuous flow biofilms (“flow biofilms”). Since the latter biofilms more closely approximate natural biofilms, development of a high-throughput (HTP) method for screening them is desirable. We describe here a new method using a device comprised of microfluidic channels and a distributed pneumatic pump (BioFlux) that provides fluid flow to 96 individual biofilms. This device allows fine control of continuous or intermittent fluid flow over a broad range of flow rates, and the use of a standard well plate format provides compatibility with plate readers. We show that use of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria, staining with propidium iodide, and measurement of fluorescence with a plate reader permit rapid and accurate determination of biofilm viability. The biofilm viability measured with the plate reader agreed with that determined using plate counts, as well as with the results of fluorescence microscope image analysis. Using BioFlux and the plate reader, we were able to rapidly screen the effects of several antimicrobials on the viability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 flow biofilms.",control biofilms requires rapid methods identify compounds effective isolate resistancecompromised mutants identifying genes involved enhanced biofilm resistance rapid screening methods microtiter plate well static biofilms available methods screening continuous flow biofilms flow biofilms since latter biofilms closely approximate natural biofilms development highthroughput htp method screening desirable describe new method using device comprised microfluidic channels distributed pneumatic pump bioflux provides fluid flow individual biofilms device allows fine control continuous intermittent fluid flow broad range flow rates use standard well plate format provides compatibility plate readers show use green fluorescent protein gfpexpressing bacteria staining propidium iodide measurement fluorescence plate reader permit rapid accurate determination biofilm viability biofilm viability measured plate reader agreed determined using plate counts well results fluorescence microscope image analysis using bioflux plate reader able rapidly screen effects several antimicrobials viability pseudomonas aeruginosa pao flow biofilms
Sigma S-dependent antioxidant defense protects stationary-phase Escherichia coli against the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4187989/,"Stationary-phase bacteria are important in disease. The σ s -regulated general stress response helps them become resistant to disinfectants, but the role of σ s in bacterial antibiotic resistance has not been elucidated. Loss of σ s rendered stationary-phase Escherichia coli more sensitive to the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin (Gm), and proteomic analysis suggested involvement of a weakened antioxidant defense. Use of the p sfiA genetic reporter, 3′-( p -hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) dye, and Amplex Red showed that Gm generated more reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mutant. HPF measurements can be distorted by cell elongation, but Gm did not affect stationary-phase cell dimensions. Coadministration of the antioxidant N -acetyl cysteine (NAC) decreased drug lethality particularly in the mutant, as did Gm treatment under anaerobic conditions that prevent ROS formation. Greater oxidative stress, due to insufficient quenching of endogenous ROS and/or respiration-linked electron leakage, therefore contributed to the greater sensitivity of the mutant; infection by a uropathogenic strain in mice showed this to be the case also in vivo . Disruption of antioxidant defense by eliminating the quencher proteins, SodA/SodB and KatE/SodA, or the pentose phosphate pathway proteins, Zwf/Gnd and TalA, which provide NADPH for ROS decomposition, also generated greater oxidative stress and killing by Gm. Thus, besides its established mode of action, Gm also kills stationary-phase bacteria by generating oxidative stress, and targeting the antioxidant defense of E. coli can enhance its efficacy. Relevant aspects of the current controversy on the role of ROS in killing by bactericidal drugs of exponential-phase bacteria, which represent a different physiological state, are discussed.",stationaryphase bacteria important disease regulated general stress response helps become resistant disinfectants role bacterial antibiotic resistance elucidated loss rendered stationaryphase escherichia coli sensitive bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin proteomic analysis suggested involvement weakened antioxidant defense use sfia genetic reporter hydroxyphenyl fluorescein hpf dye amplex red showed generated reactive oxygen species ros mutant hpf measurements distorted cell elongation affect stationaryphase cell dimensions coadministration antioxidant acetyl cysteine nac decreased drug lethality particularly mutant treatment anaerobic conditions prevent ros formation greater oxidative stress due insufficient quenching endogenous ros andor respirationlinked electron leakage therefore contributed greater sensitivity mutant infection uropathogenic strain mice showed case also vivo disruption antioxidant defense eliminating quencher proteins sodasodb katesoda pentose phosphate pathway proteins zwfgnd tala provide nadph ros decomposition also generated greater oxidative stress killing thus besides established mode action also kills stationaryphase bacteria generating oxidative stress targeting antioxidant defense coli enhance efficacy relevant aspects current controversy role ros killing bactericidal drugs exponentialphase bacteria represent different physiological state discussed
Plasma membrane disruption (PMD) formation and repair in mechanosensitive tissues,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217198/,"Mammalian cells employ an array of biological mechanisms to detect and respond to mechanical loading in their environment. One such mechanism is the formation of plasma membrane disruptions (PMD), which foster a molecular flux across cell membranes that promotes tissue adaptation. Repair of PMD through an orchestrated activity of molecular machinery is critical for cell survival, and the rate of PMD repair can affect downstream cellular signaling. PMD have been observed to influence the mechanical behavior of skin, alveolar, and gut epithelial cells, aortic endothelial cells, corneal keratocytes and epithelial cells, cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes, neurons, and most recently, bone cells including osteoblasts, periodontal ligament cells, and osteocytes. PMD are therefore positioned to affect the physiological behavior of a wide range of vertebrate organ systems including skeletal and cardiac muscle, skin, eyes, the gastrointestinal tract, the vasculature, the respiratory system, and the skeleton. The purpose of this review is to describe the processes of PMD formation and repair across these mechanosensitive tissues, with a particular emphasis on comparing and contrasting repair mechanisms and downstream signaling to better understand the role of PMD in skeletal mechanobiology. The implications of PMD-related mechanisms for disease and potential therapeutic applications are also explored.

Microgravity alters the expression of salivary proteins,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6981245/,"Objective: This study was conducted to determine if the morphology and biochemistry of the mouse submandibular gland is affected by microgravity and the spaceflight environment. Design: Tissues from female mice flown on the US space shuttle missions Space Transportation System (STS)-131 and STS-135 for 15 and 13 d, respectively, and from male mice flown on the 30 d Russian Bion-M1 biosatellite, were examined using transmission electron microscopy and light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry. Results: In contrast to the parotid gland, morphologic changes were not apparent in the submandibular gland. No significant changes in protein expression, as assessed by quantitative immunogold labeling, occurred in female mice flown for 13-15 d. In male mice, however, increased labeling for salivary androgen binding protein alpha (in acinar cell secretory granules), and epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor (in granular convoluted duct cell granules) was seen after 30 d in space. Conclusion: These results indicate that spaceflight alters secretory protein expression in the submandibular gland and suggest that the sex of the animals and the length of the flight may affect the response. These findings also show that individual salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight. Saliva contains proteins secreted from salivary glands and is easily collected, therefore is a useful biofluid for general medical analyses and in particular for monitoring the physiology and health of astronauts.

Response of the mouse sublingual gland to spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6131065/,"The ultrastructure and immunohistochemistry of secretory proteins of sublingual glands were studied in mice flown on the US space shuttles Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131) and Atlantis (STS-135). No differences in mucous acinar or serous demilune cell structure were observed between sublingual glands of ground control and flight mice. In contrast, previous studies showed autophagy and apoptosis of parotid serous acinar cells in flight mice. The expression of parotid secretory protein (PSP) in sublingual demilune cells of STS-131 flight mice was significantly increased compared to ground control mice but decreased in STS-135 flight mice. Similarly, mucin (Muc19) expression in acinar cells and PKA-RII expression in demilune cells were increased in STS-131 flight mice and decreased in STS-135 flight mice, but not significantly. Demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP) was slightly decreased in mice from both flights, and nuclear PKA-RII was slightly increased. These results indicate that the response of salivary glands to spaceflight conditions varies among the different glands, cell types and secretory proteins. Additionally, the spaceflight environment, including the effects of microgravity, modifies protein expression.

Effects of spaceflight on the mouse submandibular gland,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11233762/,"Introduction: Space is a unique environment characterized by isolation from community life and exposure to circadian misalignment, microgravity, and space radiation. These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes. The balance of the autonomic nervous system in the seromucous glands, such as the submandibular glands, precisely controls serous and mucous saliva. Psychological stress, radiation damage, and other triggers can cause an imbalance in salivary secretion systems. A previous study reported that amylase is a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying amylase regulation in the space environment are still unknown. Methods: In this study, we aimed to elucidate how lunar gravity (1/6 g ) changes mRNA expression patterns in the salivary gland. Using a multiple artificial gravity research system during space flight in the International Space Station, we studied the effects of two different gravitational levels, lunar and Earth gravity, on the submandibular glands of mice. All mice survived, returned to Earth from space, and their submandibular glands were collected 2 days after landing. Results: We found that lunar gravity induced the expression of the salivary amylase gene Amy1 ; however, no increase in Aqp5 and Ano1 , which regulate water secretion, was observed. In addition, genes involved in the exocrine system, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 ( Vamp8 ) and small G proteins, including Rap1 and Rab families, were upregulated under lunar gravity. Conclusion: These results imply that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via Rap / Rab signaling and exocytosis via Vamp8 . Our study highlights Amy1 as a potential candidate marker for stress regulation in salivary glands in the lunar gravity environment.

"Reactivation of Latent Epstein-Barr Virus: A Comparison after Exposure to Gamma, Proton, Carbon, and Iron Radiation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213004/,"Among the many stressors astronauts are exposed to during spaceflight, cosmic radiation may lead to various serious health effects. Specifically, space radiation may contribute to decreased immunity, which has been documented in astronauts during short- and long-duration missions, as evidenced by several changes in cellular immunity and plasma cytokine levels. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses, either directly from radiation of latently infected cells and/or from perturbation of the immune system, may result in disease in astronauts. Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) is one of the eight human herpes viruses known to infect more than 90% of human adults and persists for the life of the host without normally causing adverse effects. Reactivation of several latent viruses in astronauts is well documented, although the mechanism of reactivation is not well understood. We studied the effect of four different types of radiation, (1) 137 Cs gamma rays, (2) 150-MeV protons, (3) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and (4) 600 MeV/n iron ions on the activation of lytic gene transcription and of reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line (Akata) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The data showed that for all doses used in this study, lytic gene transcription was induced and median viral loads were significantly higher for all types of radiation than in corresponding control samples, with the increases detected as early as four days post-exposure and generally tapering off at later time points. The viability and size of EBV-infected Akata cells were highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time for all radiation types at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This work shows that reactivation of viruses can occur due to the effect of different types of radiation on latently infected cells in the absence of changes or cytokines produced in the immune system. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of EBV lytic gene transcription. These findings also challenge the common relative biological effectiveness concept that is often used in radiobiology for other end points.

The influence of spaceflight on the astronaut salivary microbiome and the search for a microbiome biomarker for viral reactivation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171750/,"Background Spaceflight impacts astronauts in many ways but little is known on how spaceflight affects the salivary microbiome and the consequences of these changes on astronaut health, such as viral reactivation. In order to understand this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and saliva viral titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. Results Streptococcus was the most abundant organism in the saliva, making up 8% of the total organisms detected, and their diversity decreased during spaceflight. Other organisms that had statistically significant changes were Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria which increased during flight and Actinobacteria which decreased during flight. At the genus level, Catonella , Megasphera , and Actinobacillus were absent in more than half of saliva samples collected pre-flight but were then detected during flight. In those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased during flight. Correlation analyses between the microbiome and viral titers revealed a positive correlation with Gracilibacteria , Absconditabacteria , and Abiotrophia and a negative correlation between Oribacterium , Veillonella , and Haemophilus . There was also a significant positive correlation between microbiome richness and EBV viral titers. Conclusions This is the first study to look at how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and the search for bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation. Further studies examining the role of specific organisms that were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral reactivation, a serious problem in astronauts during spaceflight, could lead to mitigation strategies to help prevent disease during both short and long duration space missions.

The cyclic nucleotide-gated channel CNGC14 regulates root gravitropism in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10414970/,"Plant roots navigate in the soil environment following the gravity vector. Cell divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H + -ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the Arabidopsis thaliana root surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H + -ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel.

Persistent NF-Œ∫B activation in muscle stem cells induces proliferation-independent telomere shortening,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8183356/,"SUMMARY During the repeated cycles of damage and repair in many muscle disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the muscle stem cell (MuSC) pool becomes less efficient at responding to and repairing damage. The underlying mechanism of such stem cell dysfunction is not fully known.

Piezo1 regulates the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscles via orchestration of stem cell morphological states.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8932657/,"Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are essential for tissue homeostasis and regeneration, but the potential contribution of MuSC morphology to in vivo function remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that quiescent MuSCs are morphologically heterogeneous and exhibit different patterns of cellular protrusions. We classified quiescent MuSCs into three functionally distinct stem cell states: responsive, intermediate, and sensory. We demonstrate that the shift between different stem cell states promotes regeneration and is regulated by the sensing protein Piezo1. Pharmacological activation of Piezo1 is sufficient to prime MuSCs toward more responsive cells. Piezo1 deletion in MuSCs shifts the distribution toward less responsive cells, mimicking the disease phenotype we find in dystrophic muscles. We further demonstrate that Piezo1 reactivation ameliorates the MuSC morphological and regenerative defects of dystrophic muscles.

Spaceflight elongates human telomeres in peripheral blood, which shorten upon return to Earth and approach baseline levels during postflight recovery. Astronauts also encounter muscle atrophy, losing up to 20% loss of muscle mass on spaceflights. Telomere length changes in muscle cells of astronauts remain unexplored. This study investigates telomere alterations in grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb unloading spaceflight mimicking model. We find telomere lengthening is present in muscle stem cells and in myofiber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident endothelial cells. We further assessed telomere length in the model following hindlimb unloading recovery. We find that telomere length failed to return to baseline values.

Endosidin2 targets conserved exocyst complex subunit EXO70 to inhibit exocytosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10264680/,"To sustain normal growth and allow rapid responses to environmental cues, plants alter the plasma membrane protein composition under different conditions presumably by regulation of delivery, stability, and internalization. Exocytosis is a conserved cellular process that delivers proteins and lipids to the plasma membrane or extracellular space in eukaryotes. The octameric exocyst complex contributes to exocytosis by tethering secretory vesicles to the correct site for membrane fusion; however, whether the exocyst complex acts universally for all secretory vesicle cargo or just for specialized subsets used during polarized growth and trafficking is currently unknown. In addition to its role in exocytosis, the exocyst complex is also known to participate in membrane recycling and autophagy. Using a previously identified small molecule inhibitor of the plant exocyst complex subunit EXO70A1, Endosidin2 (ES2), combined with a plasma membrane enrichment method and quantitative proteomic analysis, we examined the composition of plasma membrane proteins in the root of Arabidopsis seedlings, after inhibition of the ES2-targetted exocyst complex, and verified our findings by live imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins in root epidermal cells. The abundance of 145 plasma membrane proteins was significantly reduced following short-term ES2 treatments and these likely represent candidate cargo proteins of exocyst-mediated trafficking. Gene Ontology analysis showed that these proteins play diverse functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, membrane transport, and nutrient uptake.

"A conditional mutation in SCD1 reveals linkage between PIN protein trafficking, auxin transport, gravitropism, and lateral root initiation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358545/,"Auxin is transported in plants with distinct polarity, defined by transport proteins of the PIN-formed (PIN) family. Components of the complex trafficking machinery responsible for polar PIN protein localization have been identified by genetic approaches, but severe developmental phenotypes of trafficking mutants complicate dissection of this pathway. We utilized a temperature sensitive allele of Arabidopsis thaliana SCD1 ( stomatal cytokinesis defective1 ) that encodes a RAB-guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Auxin transport, lateral root initiation, asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression after gravitropic reorientation, and differential gravitropic growth were reduced in the roots of the scd1-1 mutant relative to wild type at the restrictive temperature of 25°C, but not at the permissive temperature of 18°C. In scd1-1 at 25°C, PIN1- and PIN2-GFP accumulated in endomembrane bodies. Transition of seedlings from 18 to 25°C for as little as 20 min resulted in the accumulation of PIN2-GFP in endomembranes, while gravitropism and root developmental defects were not detected until hours after transition to the non-permissive temperature. The endomembrane compartments that accumulated PIN2-GFP in scd1-1 exhibited FM4-64 signal colocalized with ARA7 and ARA6 fluorescent marker proteins, consistent with PIN2 accumulation in the late or multivesicular endosome. These experiments illustrate the power of using a temperature sensitive mutation in the gene encoding SCD1 to study the trafficking of PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane. Using the conditional feature of this mutation, we show that altered trafficking of PIN2 precedes altered auxin transport and defects in gravitropism and lateral root development in this mutant upon transition to the restrictive temperature.

In our study, we used a simulated microgravity device, a 3-D clinostat (Gravite), to investigate whether the LINC complex mediates cellular responses to the simulated microgravity environment.

Because most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 °C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO 2 -enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identified as species of the genus Carnobacterium , most closely related to C. inhibens (five isolates) and C. viridans (one isolate).

In contrast, despite the fact that the growth of most bacteria is inhibited at pressures below ∼2.5 kPa, little is known of microbial responses to low pressure (LP). To study the global LP response, we performed transcription microarrays on Bacillus subtilis cells grown under normal atmospheric pressure (∼101 kPa) and a nearly inhibitory LP (5 kPa), equivalent to the pressure found at an altitude of ∼20 km. Microarray analysis revealed altered levels of 363 transcripts belonging to several global regulons (AbrB, CcpA, CodY, Fur, IolR, ResD, Rok, SigH, Spo0A). Notably, the highest number of upregulated genes, 86, belonged to the SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR) regulon.

"Resistance of Bacillus subtilis Spore DNA to Lethal Ionizing Radiation Damage Relies Primarily on Spore Core Components and DNA Repair, with Minor Effects of Oxygen Radical Detoxification",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3911009/,"The roles of various core components, including α/β/γ-type small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP), dipicolinic acid (DPA), core water content, and DNA repair by apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), in Bacillus subtilis spore resistance to different types of ionizing radiation including X rays, protons, and high-energy charged iron ions have been studied. Spores deficient in DNA repair by NHEJ or AP endonucleases, the oxidative stress response, or protection by major α/β-type SASP, DPA, and decreased core water content were significantly more sensitive to ionizing radiation than wild-type spores, with highest sensitivity to high-energy-charged iron ions. DNA repair via NHEJ and AP endonucleases appears to be the most important mechanism for spore resistance to ionizing radiation, whereas oxygen radical detoxification via the MrgA-mediated oxidative stress response or KatX catalase activity plays only a very minor role.

Experimental Evolution of Bacillus subtilis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11673879/,"Simple Summary As global temperatures rise due to climate change, understanding how bacteria respond to heat is essential. Bacteria are critical to ecosystems, helping recycle nutrients, break down organic matter, and support plant growth. If they struggle to adapt to warmer conditions, the effects could ripple through ecosystems. Our study tested whether Bacillus bacteria, common in soil and water, could adapt to gradual temperature increases. We exposed seven strains from two groups to experimental evolution under increasing warming conditions, expecting them to evolve heat tolerance. Although some bacteria showed small improvements in heat tolerance, neither group could evolve to grow well at temperatures just three degrees Celsius above their natural range. This is concerning, as climate change could raise global temperatures by 2–4 °C, which could push these bacteria beyond their limits. We also found that c-di-AMP, a molecule that helps regulate potassium levels in cells, was involved in temperature tolerance. These findings highlight the vulnerability of essential bacteria to climate change and underscore the need for further research to predict and mitigate its impacts on ecosystems.

Cultivation in space flight produces minimal alterations in the susceptibility of Bacillus subtilis cells to 72 different antibiotics and growth-inhibiting compounds,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5648920/,"Past results have suggested that bacterial antibiotic susceptibility is altered during space flight. To test this notion, Bacillus subtilis cells were cultivated in matched hardware, medium, and environmental conditions either in space flight microgravity on the International Space Station, termed flight (FL) samples, or at Earth-normal gravity, termed ground control (GC) samples. The susceptibility of FL and GC samples was compared to 72 antibiotics and growth-inhibitory compounds using the Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) system. Only 9 compounds were identified by PM screening as exhibiting significant differences ( P < 0.05, Student's t test) in FL versus GC samples: 6-mercaptopurine, cesium chloride, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, manganese(II) chloride, nalidixic acid, penimepicycline, rolitetracycline, and trifluoperazine. Testing of the same compounds by standard broth dilution assay did not reveal statistically significant differences in the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) between FL and GC samples. The results indicate that the susceptibility of B. subtilis cells to a wide range of antibiotics and growth inhibitors is not dramatically altered by space flight.

Environmental dependence of competitive fitness in rifampin-resistant rpoB mutants of Bacillus subtilis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8904044/,"RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a highly conserved macromolecular machine that contributes to the flow of genetic information from genotype to phenotype. In Bacillus subtilis , mutations in the rpoB gene encoding the β-subunit of RNAP have been shown to alter a number of global phenotypes, including growth, utilization of unusual nutrient sources, sporulation, germination, and production of secondary metabolites. In addition, the spectrum of mutations in rpoB leading to rifampin resistance (Rif r ) can change dramatically depending upon the environment to which B. subtilis cells or spores are exposed. Rif r rpoB mutations have historically been associated with slower growth and reduced fitness; however, these assessments of fitness were conducted on limited collections of mutants in rich laboratory media that poorly reflect natural environments typically inhabited by B. subtilis . Using a novel deep-sequencing approach in addition to traditional measurements of growth rate, lag time, and pairwise competitions, we demonstrated that the competitive advantages of specific rpoB alleles differ depending on the growth environment in which they are determined. IMPORTANCE Microbial resistance to antibiotics is a growing threat to public health across the world. Historically, resistance to antibiotics has been associated with reduced fitness. A growing body of evidence indicates that resistance to rifampin, a frontline antibiotic used to treat mycobacterial and biofilm-associated infections, may increase fitness given an appropriate environment even in the absence of the selective antibiotic. Here, we experimentally confirm this phenomenon by directly comparing the fitness of multiple rifampin-resistant mutants of Bacillus subtilis in rich LB medium and an asparagine minimal medium. Our research demonstrates that the fitness cost of rifampin resistance can vary greatly depending upon the environment. This has important implications for understanding how microbes develop antimicrobial resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection.

However, little is known about the role of SPI-1 in mediating gastrointestinal disease in humans. Recently, SPI-1 deficient nontyphoidal Salmonella strains were isolated from infected humans and animals, indicating that SPI-1 is not required to cause enteropathogenesis and demonstrating the need for more in vivo- like models. Here, we utilized a previously characterized 3-D organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium to elucidate the role of all characterized Salmonella enterica T3SSs. Similar to in vivo reports, the Salmonella SPI-1 T3SS was not required to invade 3-D intestinal cells. Additionally, Salmonella strains carrying single (SPI-1 or SPI-2), double (SPI-1/2) and complete T3SS knockout (SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC ) also invaded 3-D intestinal cells to wildtype levels. Invasion of wildtype and TTSS mutants was a Salmonella active process, whereas non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial size beads, and heat-killed Salmonella did not invade 3-D cells. Wildtype and T3SS mutants did not preferentially target different cell types identified within the 3-D intestinal aggregates, including M-cells/M-like cells, enterocytes, or Paneth cells. Moreover, each T3SS was necessary for substantial intracellular bacterial replication within 3-D cells.

The HPV life cycle is differentiation-dependent, requiring tissue culture methodology able to recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) stratified epithelium. Here we report two distinct and complementary methods to grow differentiating epithelial tissues that mimic many critical morphological and biochemical aspects of in vivo tissue. The first approach involves growing primary human epithelial cells on top of a dermal equivalent consisting of collagen fibers and living fibroblast cells. When these cells are grown at the liquid-air interface, differentiation occurs and allows for epithelial stratification. The second approach uses a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. The low-fluid-shear microgravity environment inside the bioreactor allows the cells to use collagen-coated microbeads as a growth scaffold and self assemble into 3D cellular aggregates. These approaches are applied to epithelial cells derived from HPV-positive and -negative oral and cervical tissues. The second part of the protocol introduces potential downstream applications for these 3D tissue models. We describe methods that will allow readers to start successfully culturing 3D tissues from oral and cervical cells.

Induction of attachment-independent biofilm formation and repression of Hfq expression by low-fluid-shear culture of Staphylococcus aureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3187170/,"The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus encounters a wide variety of fluid shear levels within the human host, and they may play a key role in dictating whether this organism adopts a commensal interaction with the host or transitions to cause disease. By using rotating-wall vessel bioreactors to create a physiologically relevant, low-fluid-shear environment, S. aureus was evaluated for cellular responses that could impact its colonization and virulence. S. aureus cells grown in a low-fluid-shear environment initiated a novel attachment-independent biofilm phenotype and were completely encased in extracellular polymeric substances. Compared to controls, low-shear-cultured cells displayed slower growth and repressed virulence characteristics, including decreased carotenoid production, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, and reduced survival in whole blood. Transcriptional whole-genome microarray profiling suggested alterations in metabolic pathways. Further genetic expression analysis revealed downregulation of the RNA chaperone Hfq, which parallels low-fluid-shear responses of certain Gram-negative organisms. This is the first study to report an Hfq association with fluid shear in a Gram-positive organism, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved response to fluid shear among structurally diverse prokaryotes. Collectively, our results suggest S. aureus responds to a low-fluid-shear environment by initiating a biofilm/colonization phenotype with diminished virulence characteristics, which could lead to insight into key factors influencing the divergence between infection and colonization during the initial host-pathogen interaction.",opportunistic pathogen staphylococcus aureus encounters wide variety fluid shear levels within human host may play key role dictating whether organism adopts commensal interaction host transitions cause disease using rotatingwall vessel bioreactors create physiologically relevant lowfluidshear environment aureus evaluated cellular responses could impact colonization virulence aureus cells grown lowfluidshear environment initiated novel attachmentindependent biofilm phenotype completely encased extracellular polymeric substances compared controls lowshearcultured cells displayed slower growth repressed virulence characteristics including decreased carotenoid production increased susceptibility oxidative stress reduced survival whole blood transcriptional wholegenome microarray profiling suggested alterations metabolic pathways genetic expression analysis revealed downregulation rna chaperone hfq parallels lowfluidshear responses certain gramnegative organisms first study report hfq association fluid shear grampositive organism suggesting evolutionarily conserved response fluid shear among structurally diverse prokaryotes collectively results suggest aureus responds lowfluidshear environment initiating biofilmcolonization phenotype diminished virulence characteristics could lead insight key factors influencing divergence infection colonization initial hostpathogen interaction
Characterization of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ydcI gene which encodes a conserved DNA binding protein required for full acid stress resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3133089/,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium possesses a stimulon of genes that are differentially regulated in response to conditions of low fluid shear force that increase bacterial virulence and alter other phenotypes. In this study, we show that a previously uncharacterized member of this stimulon, ydcI or STM1625, encodes a highly conserved DNA binding protein with related homologs present in a range of Gram-negative bacterial genera. Gene expression analysis shows that ydcI is expressed in different bacterial genera and is involved in its autoregulation in S . Typhimurium. We demonstrate that purified YdcI protein specifically binds a DNA probe consisting of its own promoter sequence. We constructed an S . Typhimurium Δ ydcI mutant strain and show that this strain is more sensitive to both organic and inorganic acid stress than is an isogenic WT strain, and this defect is complemented in trans . Moreover, our data indicate that ydcI is part of the rpoS regulon related to stress resistance. The S . Typhimurium Δ ydcI mutant was able to invade cultured cells to the same degree as the WT strain, but a strain in which ydcI expression is induced invaded cells at a level 2.8 times higher than that of the WT. In addition, induction of ydcI expression in S . Typhimurium resulted in the formation of a biofilm in stationary-phase cultures.

Evaluation of microorganisms cultured from injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites in endangered giant aquatic Ozark Hellbender salamanders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3242767/,"Investigation into the causes underlying the rapid, global amphibian decline provides critical insight into the effects of changing ecosystems. Hypothesized and confirmed links between amphibian declines, disease, and environmental changes are increasingly represented in published literature. However, there are few long-term amphibian studies that include data on population size, abnormality/injury rates, disease, and habitat variables to adequately assess changes through time. We cultured and identified microorganisms isolated from abnormal/injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites of the endangered Ozark Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi , to discover potential causative agents responsible for their significant decline in health and population. This organism and our study site were chosen because the population and habitat of C. a. bishopi have been intensively studied from 1969–2009, and the abnormality/injury rate and apparent lack of regeneration were established. Although many bacterial and fungal isolates recovered were common environmental organisms, several opportunistic pathogens were identified in association with only the injured tissues of C.a. bishopi . Bacterial isolates included Aeromonas hydrophila , a known amphibian pathogen, Granulicetella adiacens , Gordonai terrae , Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , Aerococcus viridans , Streptococcus pneumoniae and a variety of Pseudomonads, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa , P. stutzeri , and P. alcaligenes . Fungal isolates included species in the genera Penicillium , Acremonium , Cladosporium , Curvularia , Fusarium , Streptomycetes , and the Class Hyphomycetes. Many of the opportunistic pathogens identified are known to form biofilms. Lack of isolation of the same organism from all wounds suggests that the etiological agent responsible for the damage to C. a. bishopi may not be a single organism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to profile the external microbial consortia cultured from a Cryptobranchid salamander. The incidence of abnormalities/injury and retarded regeneration in C. a. bishopi may have many contributing factors including disease and habitat degradation.

Transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to spaceflight conditions involve Hfq regulation and reveal a role for oxygen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3067220/,"Assessing bacterial behavior in microgravity is important for risk assessment and prevention of infectious diseases during spaceflight missions. Furthermore, this research field allows the unveiling of novel connections between low-fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the spaceflight-induced global transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , an opportunistic pathogen that is present in the space habitat. P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq as a global transcriptional regulator. Since Hfq was also differentially regulated in spaceflight-grown Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator acting across bacterial species. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight were the lecA and lecB lectin genes and the gene for rhamnosyltransferase ( rhlA ), which is involved in rhamnolipid production. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data for this organism grown in microgravity analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Interesting similarities were observed, including, among others, similarities with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen metabolism. While RWV-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight presumably adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrification was most prominent. Whether the observed changes in pathogenesis-related gene expression in response to spaceflight culture could lead to an alteration of virulence in P. aeruginosa remains to be determined and will be important for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during spaceflight missions and for the general public.",assessing bacterial behavior microgravity important risk assessment prevention infectious diseases spaceflight missions furthermore research field allows unveiling novel connections lowfluidshear regions encountered pathogens natural infection process bacterial virulence study first characterize spaceflightinduced global transcriptional proteomic responses pseudomonas aeruginosa opportunistic pathogen present space habitat aeruginosa responded spaceflight conditions differential regulation genes proteins hfq global transcriptional regulator since hfq also differentially regulated spaceflightgrown salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium hfq represents first spaceflightinduced regulator acting across bacterial species major aeruginosa virulencerelated genes induced spaceflight leca lecb lectin genes gene rhamnosyltransferase rhla involved rhamnolipid production transcriptional response spaceflightgrown aeruginosa compared previous data organism grown microgravity analogue conditions using rotating wall vessel rwv bioreactor interesting similarities observed including among others similarities regard hfq regulation oxygen metabolism rwvgrown aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved microaerophilic metabolism aeruginosa cultured spaceflight presumably adopted anaerobic mode growth denitrification prominent whether observed changes pathogenesisrelated gene expression response spaceflight culture could lead alteration virulence aeruginosa remains determined important infectious disease risk assessment prevention spaceflight missions general public

APEC strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9), containing three large plasmids [pChi7122-1 (IncFIB/FIIA-FIC), pChi7122-2 (IncFII), and pChi7122-3 (IncI 2 )]; and a small plasmid pChi7122-4 (ColE2-like), has been used for many years as a model strain to study the molecular mechanisms of ExPEC pathogenicity and zoonotic potential. We previously sequenced and characterized the plasmid pChi7122-1 and determined its importance in systemic APEC infection; however the roles of the other pChi7122 plasmids were still ambiguous. Herein we present the sequence of the remaining pChi7122 plasmids, confirming that pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 encode an ABC iron transport system ( eitABCD ) and a putative type IV fimbriae respectively, whereas pChi7122-4 is a cryptic plasmid. New features were also identified, including a gene cluster on pChi7122-2 that is not present in other E. coli strains but is found in Salmonella serovars and is predicted to encode the sugars catabolic pathways. In vitro evaluation of the APEC χ7122 derivative strains with the three large plasmids, either individually or in combinations, provided new insights into the role of plasmids in biofilm formation, bile and acid tolerance, and the interaction of E. coli strains with 3-D cultures of intestinal epithelial cells.

Effects of Sex and Gender on Adaptation to Space: Immune System,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7467030/,"To address urgent need for strategies to limit mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this review describes experimental, clinical and epidemiological evidence that suggests that chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before infection might increase risk of COVID-19 mortality in multiple ways. Sub-optimal hydration is associated with key risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, including older age, male sex, race-ethnicity and chronic disease. Chronic hypertonicity, total body water deficit and/or hypovolemia cause multiple intracellular and/or physiologic adaptations that preferentially retain body water and favor positive total body water balance when challenged by infection. Via effects on serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) signaling, aldosterone, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and/or Na + /K + -ATPase, chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before exposure to COVID-19 may conceivably result in: greater abundance of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the lung, which increases likelihood of COVID-19 infection, lung epithelial cells which are pre-set for exaggerated immune response, increased capacity for capillary leakage of fluid into the airway space, and/or reduced capacity for both passive and active transport of fluid out of the airways. The hypothesized hydration effects suggest hypotheses regarding strategies for COVID-19 risk reduction, such as public health recommendations to increase intake of drinking water, hydration screening alongside COVID-19 testing, and treatment tailored to the pre-infection hydration condition. Hydration may link risk factors and pathways in a unified mechanism for COVID-19 mortality.

We demonstrate that decellularized mouse lungs recellularized in a dynamic low fluid shear suspension bioreactor, termed the rotating wall vessel (RWV), contained more cells with decreased apoptosis, increased proliferation and enhanced levels of total RNA compared to static recellularization conditions. These results were observed with two relevant mouse cell types: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (C10). In addition, MSCs cultured in decellularized lungs under static but not bioreactor conditions formed multilayered aggregates. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses suggested differentiation of MSCs into collagen I-producing fibroblast-like cells in the bioreactor, indicating enhanced potential for remodeling of the decellularized scaffold matrix.

Three-dimensional organotypic co-culture model of intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages to study Salmonella enterica colonization patterns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5460263/,"Three-dimensional models of human intestinal epithelium mimic the differentiated form and function of parental tissues often not exhibited by two-dimensional monolayers and respond to Salmonella in key ways that reflect in vivo infections. To further enhance the physiological relevance of three-dimensional models to more closely approximate in vivo intestinal microenvironments encountered by Salmonella , we developed and validated a novel three-dimensional co-culture infection model of colonic epithelial cells and macrophages using the NASA Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor. First, U937 cells were activated upon collagen-coated scaffolds. HT-29 epithelial cells were then added and the three-dimensional model was cultured in the bioreactor until optimal differentiation was reached, as assessed by immunohistochemical profiling and bead uptake assays. The new co-culture model exhibited in vivo-like structural and phenotypic characteristics, including three-dimensional architecture, apical-basolateral polarity, well-formed tight/adherens junctions, mucin, multiple epithelial cell types, and functional macrophages.

Rapid phenotypic response of LSMMG-'primed' Candida albicans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11888247/,"Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is a common component of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of humans.

However, the effects of C. albicans blooms on the host in the context of AUD or AUD-related phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied. In this work, we report a reduction in ethanol consumption and preference in mice colonized with C. albicans . C. albicans -colonized mice exhibited elevated levels of serum PGE 2 and reduced ethanol preference was reversed by injection with antagonists of PGE 2 receptors. Further, injection of mice with a PGE 2 derivative decreased their ethanol preference. These results show that PGE 2 acting on its receptors EP1 and EP2 drives reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans -colonized mice. We also showed altered transcription of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum of C. albicans -colonized mice and more rapid acquisition of ethanol conditioned taste aversion, suggesting alterations to reinforcement or aversion learning. Finally, C. albicans -colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral effects of ethanol.

Spaceflight enhances cell aggregation and random budding in Candida albicans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3851762/,"This study presents the first global transcriptional profiling and phenotypic characterization of the major human opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans , grown in spaceflight conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 452 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.3% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans –induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans . A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested, as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans . While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed under the conditions of this study.

"Growth and antifungal resistance of the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans, in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station: An aggregate of multiple flight experiences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8067245/,"This report was designed to compare spaceflight-induced cellular and physiological adaptations of Candida albicans cultured in microgravity on the International Space Station across several payloads. C. albicans is a common opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for a variety of superficial infections as well as systemic and more severe infections in humans. Cumulatively, the propensity of this organism to be widespread through the population, the ability to produce disease in immunocompromised individuals, and the tendency to respond to environmental stress with characteristics associated with increased virulence, require a better understanding of the yeast response to microgravity for spaceflight crew safety. As such, the responses of this yeast cultivated during several missions using two in-flight culture bioreactors were analyzed and compared herein. In general, C. albicans had a slightly shorter generation time and higher growth propensity in microgravity as compared to terrestrial controls. Rates of cell filamentation differed between bioreactors, but were low and not significantly different between flight and terrestrial controls. Viable cells were retrieved and cultured, resulting in a colony morphology that was similar between cells cultivated in flight and in terrestrial control conditions, and in contrast to that previously observed in a ground-based microgravity analog system. Of importance, yeast demonstrated an increased resistance when challenged during spaceflight with the antifungal agent, amphotericin B. Similar levels of resistance were not observed when challenged with the functionally disparate antifungal drug caspofungin.

Challenges and considerations for single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics sample collection during spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9701605/,"Summary Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) have experienced rapid development in recent years. The findings of spaceflight-based scRNA-seq and SRT investigations are likely to improve our understanding of life in space and our comprehension of gene expression in various cell systems and tissue dynamics.

Microfluidics-enabled method to identify modes of Caenorhabditis elegans paralysis in four anthelmintics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3838407/,"The discovery of new drugs is often propelled by the increasing resistance of parasites to existing drugs and the availability of better technology platforms. The area of microfluidics has provided devices for faster screening of compounds, controlled sampling/sorting of whole animals, and automated behavioral pattern recognition. In most microfluidic devices, drug effects on small animals (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans ) are quantified by an end-point, dose response curve representing a single parameter (such as worm velocity or stroke frequency). Here, we present a multi-parameter extraction method to characterize modes of paralysis in C. elegans over an extended time period. A microfluidic device with real-time imaging is used to expose C. elegans to four anthelmintic drugs (i.e., pyrantel, levamisole, tribendimidine, and methyridine). We quantified worm behavior with parameters such as curls per second, types of paralyzation, mode frequency, and number/duration of active/immobilization periods. Each drug was chosen at EC 75 where 75% of the worm population is responsive to the drug. At equipotent concentrations, we observed differences in the manner with which worms paralyzed in drug environments.

Multiparameter behavioral analyses provide insights to mechanisms of cyanide resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3748764/,"Environmental toxicants influence development, behavior, and ultimately survival. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be an exceptionally powerful model for toxicological studies. Here, we develop novel technologies to describe the effects of cyanide toxicity with high spatiotemporal resolution. Importantly, we use these methods to examine the genetic underpinnings of cyanide resistance. Caenorhabditis elegans that lack the EGL-9 oxygen sensing enzyme have been shown to be resistant to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas produced by the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We demonstrate that the cyanide resistance exhibited by egl-9 mutants is completely dependent on the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor and is mediated by the cysl-2 cysteine synthase, which likely functions in metabolic pathways that inactivate cyanide. Further, the expression of cysl-2 correlates with the degree of cyanide resistance exhibited in each genetic background. We find that each mutant exhibits similar relative resistance to HCN gas on plates or to aqueous potassium cyanide in microfluidic chambers. The design of the microfluidic devices, in combination with real-time imaging, addresses a series of challenges presented by mutant phenotypes and by the chemical nature of the toxicant. The microfluidic assay produces a set of behavioral parameters with increased resolution that describe cyanide toxicity and resistance in C. elegans , and this is particularly useful in analyzing subtle phenotypes. These multiparameter analyses of C. elegans behavior hold great potential as a means to monitor the effects of toxicants or chemical interventions in real time and to study the biological networks that underpin toxicant resistance.

Growth performance and root transcriptome remodeling of Arabidopsis in response to Mars-like levels of magnesium sulfate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2925951/,"Background Martian regolith (unconsolidated surface material) is a potential medium for plant growth in bioregenerative life support systems during manned missions on Mars. However, hydrated magnesium sulfate mineral levels in the regolith of Mars can reach as high as 10 wt%, and would be expected to be highly inhibitory to plant growth. Methodology and Principal Findings Disabling ion transporters AtMRS2-10 and AtSULTR1;2, which are plasma membrane localized in peripheral root cells, is not an effective way to confer tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils. Arabidopsis mrs2-10 and sel1-10 knockout lines do not mitigate the growth inhibiting impacts of high MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O concentrations observed with wildtype plants. A global approach was used to identify novel genes with potential to enhance tolerance to high MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O (magnesium sulfate) stress. The early Arabidopsis root transcriptome response to elevated concentrations of magnesium sulfate was characterized in Col-0, and also between Col-0 and the mutant line cax1-1 , which was confirmed to be relatively tolerant of high levels of MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O in soil solution. Differentially expressed genes in Col-0 treated for 45 min. encode enzymes primarily involved in hormone metabolism, transcription factors, calcium-binding proteins, kinases, cell wall related proteins and membrane-based transporters. Over 200 genes encoding transporters were differentially expressed in Col-0 up to 180 min. of exposure, and one of the first down-regulated genes was CAX1 . The importance of this early response in wildtype Arabidopsis is exemplified in the fact that only four transcripts were differentially expressed between Col-0 and cax1-1 at 180 min. after initiation of treatment. Conclusions/Significance The results provide a solid basis for the understanding of the metabolic response of plants to elevated magnesium sulfate soils; it is the first transcriptome analysis of plants in this environment. The results foster the development of Mars soil-compatible plants by showing that cax1 mutants exhibit partial tolerance to magnesium sulfate, and by elucidating a small subset (500 vs. >10,000) of candidate genes for mutation or metabolic engineering that will enhance tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils.",background martian regolith unconsolidated surface material potential medium plant growth bioregenerative life support systems manned missions mars however hydrated magnesium sulfate mineral levels regolith mars reach high would expected highly inhibitory plant growth methodology principal findings disabling ion transporters atmrs atsultr plasma membrane localized peripheral root cells effective way confer tolerance magnesium sulfate soils arabidopsis mrs sel knockout lines mitigate growth inhibiting impacts high mgso concentrations observed wildtype plants global approach used identify novel genes potential enhance tolerance high mgso magnesium sulfate stress early arabidopsis root transcriptome response elevated concentrations magnesium sulfate characterized col also col mutant line cax confirmed relatively tolerant high levels mgso soil solution differentially expressed genes col treated min encode enzymes primarily involved hormone metabolism transcription factors calciumbinding proteins kinases cell wall related proteins membranebased transporters genes encoding transporters differentially expressed col min exposure one first downregulated genes cax importance early response wildtype arabidopsis exemplified fact four transcripts differentially expressed col cax min initiation treatment conclusionssignificance results provide solid basis understanding metabolic response plants elevated magnesium sulfate soils first transcriptome analysis plants environment results foster development mars soilcompatible plants showing cax mutants exhibit partial tolerance magnesium sulfate elucidating small subset candidate genes mutation metabolic engineering enhance tolerance magnesium sulfate soils
The 14-3-3 proteins of Arabidopsis regulate root growth and chloroplast development as components of the photosensory system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3350920/,"The 14-3-3 proteins specifically bind a number of client proteins to influence important pathways, including flowering timing via the photosensory system. For instance, 14-3-3 proteins influence the photosensory system through interactions with Constans (CO) protein. 14-3-3 associations with the photosensory system were further studied in this investigation using 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants to study root and chloroplast development. The 14-3-3 μ T-DNA insertion mutant, 14-3-3μ-1 , had shorter roots than the wild type and the difference in root length could be influenced by light intensity. The 14-3-3 ν T-DNA insertion mutants also had shorter roots, but only when grown under narrow-bandwidth red light. Five-day-old 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion and co mutants all had increased root greening compared with the wild type, which was influenced by light wavelength and intensity. However, beyond 10 d of growth, 14-3-3μ-1 roots did not increase in greening as much as wild-type roots.

14-3-3 phosphoprotein interaction networks - does isoform diversity present functional interaction specification?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3422896/,"The 14-3-3 proteins have emerged as major phosphoprotein interaction proteins and thereby constitute a key node in the Arabidopsis Interactome Map, a node through which a large number of important signals pass. Throughout their history of discovery and description, the 14-3-3s have been described as protein families and there has been some evidence that the different 14-3-3 family members within any organism might carry isoform-specific functions. However, there has also been evidence for redundancy of 14-3-3 function, suggesting that the perceived 14-3-3 diversity may be the accumulation of neutral mutations over evolutionary time and as some 14-3-3 genes develop tissue or organ-specific expression. This situation has led to a currently unresolved question – does 14-3-3 isoform sequence diversity indicate functional diversity at the biochemical or cellular level? We discuss here some of the key observations on both sides of the resulting debate, and present a set of contrastable observations to address the theory functional diversity does exist among 14-3-3 isoforms. The resulting model suggests strongly that there are indeed functional specificities in the 14-3-3s of Arabidopsis. The model further suggests that 14-3-3 diversity and specificity should enter into the discussion of 14-3-3 roles in signal transduction and be directly approached in 14-3-3 experimentation. It is hoped that future studies involving 14-3-3s will continue to address specificity in experimental design and analysis.

Plant growth strategies are remodeled by spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11869762/,"Background During medium- to long-duration spaceflights, real-time microgravity can increase the health risks of astronauts. In particular, the disruption of intestinal homeostasis is closely related to other health problems, and it is necessary to monitor related treatment strategies. Ginseng is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine often used to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), which are the bioactive components of ginseng, have been reported to regulate immune homeostasis, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidation. This study focused on the regulation of GTSs in intestinal homeostasis imbalance caused by microgravity. Methods A hindlimb suspension (HLS) rat model was established to evaluate the intestinal protective effects of GTSs. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using RNA-Seq. RT-PCR was performed to further focus and verify these results. The gut microbiome composition was examined based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the short-chain fatty acids produced were further analyzed. Results We found that GTSs intervention effectively improved the intestinal injury caused by simulated weightlessness, including reducing the pathological damage, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins and reducing the levels of inflammatory factors. Moreover, GTSs treatment significantly restored the levels of intestinal immunity-related genes and remodeled the gut microbiota. In particular, GTSs significantly increased the abundance of short-chain fatty acid metabolism-related bacteria, thereby increasing the level of propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid. Conclusion Our results revealed that GTSs improved intestinal microecological disorders and impaired immune function caused by the weightlessness simulation. The underlying mechanism may be related to the “intestinal immune -microbiota-metabolic” pathway. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the precise design and development of GTSs for space-health products.

Spaceflight transcriptomes: unique responses to a novel environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10712242/,"Spaceflight presents a unique environment with complex stressors, including microgravity and radiation, that can influence plant physiology at molecular levels. Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis’ molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (µ g ) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space.

Organ-specific remodeling of the Arabidopsis transcriptome in response to spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10058394/,"Plants have been recognized as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for space exploration, and many experiments have been carried out to evaluate their adaptability to spaceflight. Unfortunately, few of these experiments have involved monocot plants, which constitute most of the crops used on Earth as sources of food, feed, and fiber. To better understand the ability of monocot plants to adapt to spaceflight, we germinated and grew Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions in a customized growth unit on the International Space Station, along with 1-g ground controls. At the end of a 4-day growth period, seedling organ’s growth and morphologies were quantified, and root and shoot transcriptomic profiles were investigated using RNA-seq. The roots of all three accessions grew more slowly and displayed longer root hairs under microgravity conditions relative to ground control. On the other hand, the shoots of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 grew at similar rates between conditions, whereas those of Bd21 grew more slowly under microgravity. The three Brachypodium accessions displayed dramatically different transcriptomic responses to microgravity relative to ground controls, with the largest numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found in Gaz8 (4527), followed by Bd21 (1353) and Bd21-3 (570). Only 47 and six DEGs were shared between accessions for shoots and roots, respectively, including DEGs encoding wall-associated proteins and photosynthesis-related DEGs. Furthermore, DEGs associated with the “Oxidative Stress Response” GO group were up-regulated in the shoots and down-regulated in the roots of Bd21 and Gaz8, indicating that Brachypodium roots and shoots deploy distinct biological strategies to adapt to the microgravity environment. A comparative analysis of the Brachypodium oxidative-stress response DEGs with the Arabidopsis ROS wheel suggests a connection between retrograde signaling, light response, and decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes in microgravity-exposed shoots. In Gaz8, DEGs were also found to preferentially associate with the “Plant Hormonal Signaling” and “MAP Kinase Signaling” KEGG pathways. Overall, these data indicate that Brachypodium distachyon seedlings exposed to the microgravity environment of ISS display accession- and organ-specific responses that involve oxidative stress response, wall remodeling, photosynthesis inhibition, expression regulation, ribosome biogenesis, and post-translational modifications. The general characteristics of these responses are similar to those displayed by microgravity-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. However, organ- and accession-specific components of the response dramatically differ both within and between species. These results suggest a need to directly evaluate candidate-crop responses to microgravity to better understand their specific adaptability to this novel environment and develop cultivation strategies allowing them to strive during spaceflight.

ARG1 Functions in the Physiological Adaptation of Undifferentiated Plant Cells to Spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8024390/,"Scientific access to spaceflight and especially the International Space Station has revealed that physiological adaptation to spaceflight is accompanied or enabled by changes in gene expression that significantly alter the transcriptome of cells in spaceflight. A wide range of experiments have shown that plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight involves gene expression changes that alter cell wall and other metabolisms. However, while transcriptome profiling aptly illuminates changes in gene expression that accompany spaceflight adaptation, mutation analysis is required to illuminate key elements required for that adaptation. Here we report how transcriptome profiling was used to gain insight into the spaceflight adaptation role of Altered response to gravity 1 ( Arg1 ), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study compared expression profiles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild-type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC-17 spaceflight mission. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware.

Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap.

A Member of the CONSTANS-Like Protein Family is a Putative Regulator of ROS Homeostasis and Spaceflight Physiological Adaptation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6348315/,"A feature of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in Arabidopsis thaliana ( Arabidopsis ) is the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated gene expression. The patterns of ROS-associated gene expression vary among Arabidopsis ecotypes, and the role of ROS signalling in spaceflight acclimation is unknown. What could differences in ROS gene regulation between ecotypes on orbit reveal about physiological adaptation to novel environments? Analyses of ecotype-dependent responses to spaceflight resulted in the elucidation of a previously uncharacterized gene ( OMG1 ) as being ROS-associated. The OMG1 5′ flanking region is an active promoter in cells where ROS activity is commonly observed, such as in pollen tubes, root hairs, and in other tissues upon wounding. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that upon wounding on Earth, OMG1 is an apparent transcriptional regulator of MYB77 and GRX480 , which are associated with the ROS pathway. Fluorescence-based ROS assays show that OMG1 affects ROS production. Phylogenetic analysis of OMG1 and closely related homologs suggests that OMG1 is a distant, unrecognized member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family, a member that arose via gene duplication early in the angiosperm lineage and subsequently lost its first DNA-binding B-box1 domain. These data illustrate that members of the rapidly evolving COL protein family play a role in regulating ROS pathway functions, and their differential regulation on orbit suggests a role for ROS signalling in spaceflight physiological adaptation.

HSFA2 Functions in the Physiological Adaptation of Undifferentiated Plant Cells to Spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6359015/,"Heat Shock Factor A2 (HsfA2) is part of the Heat Shock Factor (HSF) network, and plays an essential role beyond heat shock in environmental stress responses and cellular homeostatic control. Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures derived from wild type (WT) ecotype Col-0 and a knockout line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to ascertain whether the HSF network functions in the adaptation to the novel environment of spaceflight. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, genes differentially expressed between the two environments (spaceflight to ground) were identified within the same genotype, which represented physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Second, gene expression profiles were compared between the two genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment, which defined genes uniquely required by each genotype on the ground and in spaceflight-adapted states. Results showed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells’ physiological state irrespective of the environment, and likely resulted from a deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery in the mutant. Results further suggested that additional to its universal stress response role, HsfA2 also has specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction, and starch biosynthesis. Disabling HsfA2 altered the physiological state of the cells, and impacted the mechanisms induced to adapt to spaceflight, and identified HsfA2 -dependent genes that are important to the adaption of wild type cells to spaceflight.

Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio: A biomarker to monitor the immune status of astronauts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7667275/,"A comprehensive understanding of spaceflight factors involved in immune dysfunction and the evaluation of biomarkers to assess in-flight astronaut health are essential goals for NASA. An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a potential biomarker candidate, as leukocyte differentials are altered during spaceflight. In the reduced gravity environment of space, rodents and astronauts displayed elevated NLR and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios (GLR), respectively. To simulate microgravity using two well-established ground-based models, we cultured human whole blood-leukocytes in high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV) and used hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. Both HARV-RWV simulation of leukocytes and HU-exposed mice showed elevated NLR profiles comparable to spaceflight exposed samples. To assess mechanisms involved, we found the simulated microgravity HARV-RWV model resulted in an imbalance of redox processes and activation of myeloperoxidase-producing inflammatory neutrophils, while antioxidant treatment reversed these effects. In the simulated microgravity HU model, mitochondrial catalase-transgenic mice that have reduced oxidative stress responses showed reduced neutrophil counts, NLR, and a dampened release of selective inflammatory cytokines compared to wildtype HU mice, suggesting simulated microgravity induced oxidative stress responses that triggered inflammation. In brief, both spaceflight and simulated microgravity models caused elevated NLR, indicating this as a potential biomarker for future in-flight immune health monitoring.

Immunological and hematological outcomes following protracted low dose/low dose rate ionizing radiation and simulated microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8169688/,"Using a ground-based model to simulate spaceflight [21-days of single-housed, hindlimb unloading (HLU) combined with continuous low-dose gamma irradiation (LDR, total dose of 0.04 Gy)], an in-depth survey of the immune and hematological systems of mice at 7-days post-exposure was performed. Collected blood was profiled with a hematology analyzer and spleens were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing). The results revealed negligible differences in immune differentials. However, hematological system analyses of whole blood indicated large disparities in red blood cell differentials and morphology, suggestive of anemia. Murine Reactome networks indicated majority of spleen cells displayed differentially expressed genes (DEG) involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, and DNA repair. Although immune differentials were not changed, DEG analysis of the spleen revealed expression profiles associated with inflammation and dysregulated immune function persist to 1-week post-simulated spaceflight.

Epigenomic regulators elongator complex subunit 2 and methyltransferase 1 differentially condition the spaceflight response in Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475764/,"Background: Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight show transcriptomic changes that resemble aspects of several terrestrial abiotic stress responses. Under investigation here is whether epigenetic modulations, similar to those that occur in terrestrial stress responses, have a functional role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 – Epigenetic Expression experiment examined the role of cytosine methylation in spaceflight adaptation. The experiment was conducted onboard the International Space Station, and evaluated the spaceflight-altered, genome-wide methylation profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 ( met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 ( elp2-5 )] along with a wild-type Col-0 control. Results: The elp2-5 plants suffered in their physiological adaptation to spaceflight in that their roots failed to extend away from the seed and the overall development of the plants was greatly impaired in space. The met1-7 plants suffered less, with their morphology affected by spaceflight in a manner similar to that of the Col-0 controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight were dramatically different in the elp2-5 and met1-7 plants compared to Col-0, indicating that the disruptions in these mutants resulted in a reprogramming of their spaceflight responses, especially in elp2-5 . Many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome of each genotype were differentially methylated in spaceflight. In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling. However, the spaceflight transcriptomes of met1-7 and elp2-5 each presented patterns of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each other. Further, the DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe spaceflight stress response in the mutants, particularly in elp2-5 . Conclusion: Arabidopsis physiological adaptation to spaceflight results in differential DNA methylation in an organ-specific manner. Disruption of Met1 methyltransferase function does not dramatically affect spaceflight growth or morphology, yet met1-7 reprograms the spaceflight transcriptomic response in a unique manner. Disruption of elp2-5 results in poor development in spaceflight grown plants, together with a diminished, dramatically reprogrammed transcriptomic response.

However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop and many showed severe stress morphologies. Moreover, all plants grown in lunar soils differentially expressed genes indicating ionic stresses, similar to plant reactions to salt, metal and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, although in situ lunar regoliths can be useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates.

While inflight behavioral analyses of SFμg exhibit increased activity, postflight analysis displays significant climbing defects, highlighting the sensitivity of behavior to altered gravity. Multi-omics analysis shows alterations in metabolic, oxidative stress, and synaptic transmission pathways in both SFμg and SF1g; however, neurological changes immediately postflight, including neuronal loss, glial cell count alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, are seen only in SFμg. Additionally, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype in SF1g and SFμg brains, with pronounced phenotypes in SFμg, are seen upon acclimation to Earth conditions.

Here, we discuss a method utilizing KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) to both carry biology to suborbital space as well as fix that biology at certain stages of flight. Plants on support media were inserted into the sample side of KFTs preloaded with RNAlater in the fixation chamber. The KFTs were activated at various stages of a simulated flight to fix the plants. RNA-seq analysis conducted on tissue samples housed in KFTs, showed that plants behaved consistently in KFTs when compared to petri-plates. Over the time course, roots adjusted to hypoxia and leaves adjusted to changes in photosynthesis. These responses were due in part to the environment imposed by the encased triple containment of the KFTs, which is a requirement for flight in human spacecraft. While plants exhibited expected reproducible transcriptomic alteration over time in the KFTs, responses to clinorotation during the simulated flight suggest that transcriptomic responses to suborbital spaceflight can be examined using this approach.

Post-Spaceflight (STS-135) Mouse Splenocytes Demonstrate Altered Activation Properties and Surface Molecule Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4430214/,"Alterations in immune function have been documented during or post-spaceflight and in ground based models of microgravity. Identification of immune parameters that are dysregulated during spaceflight is an important step in mitigating crew health risks during deep space missions. The in vitro analysis of leukocyte activity post-spaceflight in both human and animal species is primarily focused on lymphocytic function. This report completes a broader spectrum analysis of mouse lymphocyte and monocyte changes post 13 days orbital flight (mission STS-135). Analysis includes an examination in surface markers for cell activation, and antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Cytokine production was measured after stimulation with T-cell mitogen or TLR-2, TLR-4, or TLR-5 agonists. Splenocyte surface marker analysis immediate post-spaceflight and after in vitro culture demonstrated unique changes in phenotypic populations between the flight mice and matched treatment ground controls. Post-spaceflight splenocytes (flight splenocytes) had lower expression intensity of CD4 + CD25 + and CD8 + CD25 + cells, lower percentage of CD11c + MHC II + cells, and higher percentage of CD11c + MHC I + populations compared to ground controls. The flight splenocytes demonstrated an increase in phagocytic activity. Stimulation with ConA led to decrease in CD4 + population but increased CD4 + CD25 + cells compared to ground controls. Culturing with TLR agonists led to a decrease in CD11c + population in splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls. Consequently, flight splenocytes with or without TLR-agonist stimulation showed a decrease in CD11c + MHC I + , CD11c + MHC II + , and CD11c + CD86 + cells compared to ground controls.

Our group characterized cell phenotype distributions and phagocytic function in the spleen, catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands, and transcriptomics/metabolomics in the liver. Despite decreases in most splenic leukocyte subsets, there were increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related activity. Although there were increases noted in corticosterone levels in both the adrenals and liver, there were no significant changes in catecholamine levels. Furthermore, functional analysis of gene expression and metabolomic profiles suggest that the functional changes are not due to oxidative or psychological stress. Despite changes in gene expression patterns indicative of increases in phagocytic activity (e.g. endocytosis and formation of peroxisomes), there was no corresponding increase in genes related to ROS metabolism. In contrast, there were increases in expression profiles related to fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles.

Within 3–5 h after landing, brain tissue was collected to evaluate protein expression profiles using quantitative proteomic analysis. Our results showed that there were 26 proteins that were significantly altered after spaceflight in the gray and/or white matter. While there was no overlap between the white and gray matter in terms of individual proteins, there was overlap in terms of function, synaptic plasticity, vesical activity, protein/organelle transport, and metabolism. Our data demonstrate that exposure to the spaceflight environment induces significant changes in protein expression related to neuronal structure and metabolic function. This might lead to a significant impact on brain structural and functional integrity that could affect the outcome of space missions.

Transcriptomic effects on the mouse heart following 30 days on the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9953463/,"Efforts to understand the impact of spaceflight on the human body stem from growing interest in long-term space travel. Multiple organ systems are affected by microgravity and radiation, including the cardiovascular system. Previous transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the changes in gene expression after spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of long-term spaceflight on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 days. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three flight and three comparable ground control mice and RNA sequencing was performed. Our analyses showed that 1147 transcripts were significantly regulated after spaceflight. The MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways were predicted to be activated. Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated, but no significant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Our results indicate an absence of cellular senescence, and a significant upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. Transcripts related to cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by spaceflight, suggesting that cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to long-term spaceflight.

Spaceflight-induced gene expression profiles in the mouse brain are attenuated by treatment with the antioxidant BuOE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10487739/,"The demands of deep space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment.

Basal signaling regulates plant growth and development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11942576/,"The proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinase ( PERK ) gene family is crucial to various molecular and cellular processes in plants. We identified 50 PERK genes in Brassica napus to explore their evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional roles. These genes were grouped into four classes and unevenly distributed across 18 chromosomes. Phylogenetic studies and Ka/Ks ratios revealed purifying selection during the evolution process. They exhibited significant diversification in gene length, molecular weight, and isoelectric points, suggesting specialized function. Gene structure and motif analyses revealed variations among the BnPERK family members, with conserved tyrosine kinase domains suggesting functional importance. Cis -element analysis predicted the involvement in hormone signaling and stress responses. Expression profiling showed diverse patterns across tissues and hormone treatments, highlighting potential roles in growth regulation and hormone signaling. Protein–protein interaction networks suggested BnPERK proteins interact with a wide array of proteins, implicating them in multiple biological processes. The transcriptional downregulation of four BnPERK genes upon Plasmodiophora brassicae infection implied a role in clubroot disease response.

Phosphoinositide-signaling is one component of a robust plant defense response,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4052902/,"The phosphoinositide pathway and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP 3 ) have been implicated in plant responses to many abiotic stresses; however, their role in response to biotic stress is not well characterized. In the current study, we show that both basal defense and systemic acquired resistance responses are affected in transgenic plants constitutively expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase) which have greatly reduced InsP 3 levels. Flagellin induced Ca 2+ -release as well as the expressions of some flg22 responsive genes were attenuated in the InsP 5-ptase plants. Furthermore, the InsP 5-ptase plants were more susceptible to virulent and avirulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato ( Pst ) DC3000 . The InsP 5-ptase plants had lower basal salicylic acid (SA) levels and the induction of SAR in systemic leaves was reduced and delayed. Reciprocal exudate experiments showed that although the InsP 5-ptase plants produced equally effective molecules that could trigger PR-1 gene expression in wild type plants, exudates collected from either wild type or InsP 5-ptase plants triggered less PR-1 gene expression in InsP 5-ptase plants. Additionally, expression profiles indicated that several defense genes including PR-1 , PR-2 , PR-5 , and AIG1 were basally down regulated in the InsP 5-ptase plants compared with wild type. Upon pathogen attack, expression of these genes was either not induced or showed delayed induction in systemic leaves. Our study shows that phosphoinositide signaling is one component of the plant defense network and is involved in both basal and systemic responses. The dampening of InsP 3 -mediated signaling affects Ca 2+ release, modulates defense gene expression and compromises plant defense responses.

Uncovering transcriptional responses to fractional gravity in Arabidopsis roots,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8539686/,"Although many reports characterize the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis seedlings to microgravity, few investigate the effect of partial or fractional gravity on gene expression. Understanding plant responses to fractional gravity is relevant for plant growth on lunar and Martian surfaces. The plant signaling flight experiment utilized the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The EMCS consisted of two rotors within a controlled chamber allowing for two experimental conditions, microgravity (stationary rotor) and simulated gravity in space. Seedlings were grown for 5 days under continuous light in seed cassettes. The arrangement of the seed cassettes within each experimental container results in a gradient of fractional g (in the spinning rotor). To investigate whether gene expression patterns are sensitive to fractional g , we carried out transcriptional profiling of root samples exposed to microgravity or partial g (ranging from 0.53 to 0.88 g ). Data were analyzed using DESeq2 with fractional g as a continuous variable in the design model in order to query gene expression across the gravity continuum. We identified a subset of genes whose expression correlates with changes in fractional g . Interestingly, the most responsive genes include those encoding transcription factors, defense, and cell wall-related proteins and heat shock proteins.

Conserved plant transcriptional responses to microgravity from two consecutive spaceflight experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10800490/,"Introduction Understanding how plants adapt to the space environment is essential, as plants will be a valuable component of long duration space missions. Several spaceflight experiments have focused on transcriptional profiling as a means of understanding plant adaptation to microgravity. However, there is limited overlap between results from different experiments. Differences in experimental conditions and hardware make it difficult to find a consistent response across experiments and to distinguish the primary effects of microgravity from other spaceflight effects. Methods Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) were two separate spaceflight experiments conducted on the International Space Station utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). The EMCS provided a lighted environment for plant growth with centrifugal capabilities providing an onboard 1 g control. Results and discussion An RNA-Seq analysis of shoot samples from PS and PRR revealed a significant overlap of genes differentially expressed in microgravity between the two experiments. Relative to onboard 1 g controls, genes involved in transcriptional regulation, shoot development, and response to auxin and light were upregulated in microgravity in both experiments. Conversely, genes involved in defense response, abiotic stress, Ca ++ signaling, and cell wall modification were commonly downregulated in both datasets. The downregulation of stress responses in microgravity in these two experiments is interesting as these pathways have been previously observed as upregulated in spaceflight compared to ground controls. Similarly, we have observed many stress response genes to be upregulated in the 1 g onboard control compared to ground reference controls; however these genes were specifically downregulated in microgravity. In addition, we analyzed the sRNA landscape of the 1 g and microgravity (μ g ) shoot samples from PRR. We identified three miRNAs (miR319c, miR398b, and miR8683) which were upregulated in microgravity, while several of their corresponding target genes were found to be downregulated in microgravity. Interestingly, the downregulated target genes are enriched in those encoding chloroplast-localized enzymes and proteins. These results uncover microgravity unique transcriptional changes and highlight the validity and importance of an onboard 1 g control.

RNAseq analysis of rodent spaceflight experiments is confounded by sample collection techniques,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7756143/,"Summary To understand the physiological changes that occur in response to spaceflight, mice are transported to the International Space Station (ISS) and housed for variable periods of time before euthanasia on-orbit or return to Earth. Sample collection under such difficult conditions introduces confounding factors that need to be identified and addressed. We found large changes in the transcriptome of mouse tissues dissected and preserved on-orbit compared with tissues from mice euthanized on-orbit, preserved, and dissected after return to Earth. Changes due to preservation method eclipsed those between flight and ground samples, making it difficult to identify spaceflight-specific changes. Follow-on experiments to interrogate the roles of euthanasia methods, tissue and carcass preservation protocols, and library preparation methods suggested that differences due to preservation protocols are exacerbated when coupled with polyA selection. This has important implications for the interpretation of existing datasets and the design of future experiments.

Functional changes in the snail statocyst system elicited by microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3066201/,"Background The mollusk statocyst is a mechanosensing organ detecting the animal's orientation with respect to gravity. This system has clear similarities to its vertebrate counterparts: a weight-lending mass, an epithelial layer containing small supporting cells and the large sensory hair cells, and an output eliciting compensatory body reflexes to perturbations. Methodology/Principal Findings In terrestrial gastropod snail we studied the impact of 16- (Foton M-2) and 12-day (Foton M-3) exposure to microgravity in unmanned orbital missions on: (i) the whole animal behavior ( Helix lucorum L.), (ii) the statoreceptor responses to tilt in an isolated neural preparation ( Helix lucorum L.), and (iii) the differential expression of the Helix pedal peptide (HPep) and the tetrapeptide FMRFamide genes in neural structures ( Helix aspersa L.). Experiments were performed 13–42 hours after return to Earth. Latency of body re-orientation to sudden 90° head-down pitch was significantly reduced in postflight snails indicating an enhanced negative gravitaxis response. Statoreceptor responses to tilt in postflight snails were independent of motion direction, in contrast to a directional preference observed in control animals. Positive relation between tilt velocity and firing rate was observed in both control and postflight snails, but the response magnitude was significantly larger in postflight snails indicating an enhanced sensitivity to acceleration. A significant increase in mRNA expression of the gene encoding HPep, a peptide linked to ciliary beating, in statoreceptors was observed in postflight snails; no differential expression of the gene encoding FMRFamide, a possible neurotransmission modulator, was observed. Conclusions/Significance Upregulation of statocyst function in snails following microgravity exposure parallels that observed in vertebrates suggesting fundamental principles underlie gravi-sensing and the organism's ability to adapt to gravity changes. This simple animal model offers the possibility to describe general subcellular mechanisms of nervous system's response to conditions on Earth and in space.",background mollusk statocyst mechanosensing organ detecting animals orientation respect gravity system clear similarities vertebrate counterparts weightlending mass epithelial layer containing small supporting cells large sensory hair cells output eliciting compensatory body reflexes perturbations methodologyprincipal findings terrestrial gastropod snail studied impact foton day foton exposure microgravity unmanned orbital missions whole animal behavior helix lucorum statoreceptor responses tilt isolated neural preparation helix lucorum iii differential expression helix pedal peptide hpep tetrapeptide fmrfamide genes neural structures helix aspersa experiments performed hours return earth latency body reorientation sudden headdown pitch significantly reduced postflight snails indicating enhanced negative gravitaxis response statoreceptor responses tilt postflight snails independent motion direction contrast directional preference observed control animals positive relation tilt velocity firing rate observed control postflight snails response magnitude significantly larger postflight snails indicating enhanced sensitivity acceleration significant increase mrna expression gene encoding hpep peptide linked ciliary beating statoreceptors observed postflight snails differential expression gene encoding fmrfamide possible neurotransmission modulator observed conclusionssignificance upregulation statocyst function snails following microgravity exposure parallels observed vertebrates suggesting fundamental principles underlie gravisensing organisms ability adapt gravity changes simple animal model offers possibility describe general subcellular mechanisms nervous systems response conditions earth space
Simulated microgravity impairs human NK [natural killer] cell cytotoxic activity against space radiation-relevant leukemic cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11324864/,"Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body’s defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.

Multi-analyte biochip (MAB) based on all-solid-state ion-selective electrodes (ASSISE) for physiological research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665236/,"Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications in environmental, biomedical, agricultural, biological, and spaceflight research require an ion-selective electrode (ISE) that can withstand prolonged storage in complex biological media 1-4 . An all-solid-state ion-selective-electrode (ASSISE) is especially attractive for the aforementioned applications. The electrode should have the following favorable characteristics: easy construction, low maintenance, and (potential for) miniaturization, allowing for batch processing. A microfabricated ASSISE intended for quantifying H + , Ca 2+ , and CO 3 2- ions was constructed. It consists of a noble-metal electrode layer ( i.e. Pt), a transduction layer, and an ion-selective membrane (ISM) layer. The transduction layer functions to transduce the concentration-dependent chemical potential of the ion-selective membrane into a measurable electrical signal. The lifetime of an ASSISE is found to depend on maintaining the potential at the conductive layer/membrane interface 5-7 . To extend the ASSISE working lifetime and thereby maintain stable potentials at the interfacial layers, we utilized the conductive polymer (CP) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) 7-9 in place of silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) as the transducer layer. We constructed the ASSISE in a lab-on-a-chip format, which we called the multi-analyte biochip (MAB) ( Figure 1 ). Calibrations in test solutions demonstrated that the MAB can monitor pH (operational range pH 4-9), CO 3 2- (measured range 0.01 mM - 1 mM), and Ca 2+ (log-linear range 0.01 mM to 1 mM). The MAB for pH provides a near-Nernstian slope response after almost one month storage in algal medium. The carbonate biochips show a potentiometric profile similar to that of a conventional ion-selective electrode. Physiological measurements were employed to monitor biological activity of the model system, the microalga Chlorella vulgaris . The MAB conveys an advantage in size, versatility, and multiplexed analyte sensing capability, making it applicable to many confined monitoring situations, on Earth or in space. Biochip Design and Experimental Methods The biochip is 10 x 11 mm in dimension and has 9 ASSISEs designated as working electrodes (WEs) and 5 Ag/AgCl reference electrodes (REs). Each working electrode (WE) is 240 μm in diameter and is equally spaced at 1.4 mm from the REs, which are 480 μm in diameter. These electrodes are connected to electrical contact pads with a dimension of 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm. The schematic is shown in Figure 2 . Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic deposition methods are used to electropolymerize the PEDOT films using a Bioanalytical Systems Inc. (BASI) C3 cell stand ( Figure 3 ). The counter-ion for the PEDOT film is tailored to suit the analyte ion of interest. A PEDOT with poly(styrenesulfonate) counter ion (PEDOT/PSS) is utilized for H + and CO 3 2- , while one with sulphate (added to the solution as CaSO 4 ) is utilized for Ca 2+ . The electrochemical properties of the PEDOT-coated WE is analyzed using CVs in redox-active solution ( i.e. 2 mM potassium ferricyanide (K 3 Fe(CN) 6 )). Based on the CV profile, Randles-Sevcik analysis was used to determine the effective surface area 10 . Spin-coating at 1,500 rpm is used to cast ~2 μm thick ion-selective membranes (ISMs) on the MAB working electrodes (WEs). The MAB is contained in a microfluidic flow-cell chamber filled with a 150 μl volume of algal medium; the contact pads are electrically connected to the BASI system ( Figure 4 ). The photosynthetic activity of Chlorella vulgaris is monitored in ambient light and dark conditions.

Although it is known that the unique geometry of venous valves alters the blood flow patterns and cell distribution in venous valve sinuses, the interactions between fluid flow and RBCs have not been elucidated. Here, using a dilute cell suspension in an in vitro microfluidic model of a venous valve, we quantified the spatial distribution of RBCs by microscopy and image analysis, and using micro-particle image velocimetry and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we analyzed the complex flow patterns. The results show that the local hematocrit in the valve pockets is spatially heterogeneous and is significantly different from the feed hematocrit. Above a threshold shear rate, the inertial separation of streamlines and lift forces contribute to an uneven distribution of RBCs in the vortices, the entrapment of RBCs in the vortices, and non-monotonic wall shear stresses in the valve pockets. Our experimental and computational characterization provides insights into the complex interactions between fluid flow, RBC distribution, and wall shear rates in venous valve mimics, which is of relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and improving cell separation efficiency.",motion cells orthogonal direction main flow importance natural engineered systems lateral movement red blood cells rbcs distal sudden expansion considered influence formation progression thrombosis venous valves aortic aneurysms bloodcirculating devices also determining parameter cell separation applications flowfocusing microfluidic devices although known unique geometry venous valves alters blood flow patterns cell distribution venous valve sinuses interactions fluid flow rbcs elucidated using dilute cell suspension vitro microfluidic model venous valve quantified spatial distribution rbcs microscopy image analysis using microparticle image velocimetry computational fluid dynamics simulations analyzed complex flow patterns results show local hematocrit valve pockets spatially heterogeneous significantly different feed hematocrit threshold shear rate inertial separation streamlines lift forces contribute uneven distribution rbcs vortices entrapment rbcs vortices nonmonotonic wall shear stresses valve pockets experimental computational characterization provides insights complex interactions fluid flow rbc distribution wall shear rates venous valve mimics relevance understanding pathophysiology thrombosis improving cell separation efficiency
Mammalian and Invertebrate Models as Complementary Tools for Gaining Mechanistic Insight on Muscle Responses to Spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8430797/,"Bioinformatics approaches have proven useful in understanding biological responses to spaceflight. Spaceflight experiments remain resource intensive and rare. One outstanding issue is how to maximize scientific output from a limited number of omics datasets from traditional animal models including nematodes, fruitfly, and rodents. The utility of omics data from invertebrate models in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight has not been fully explored. Hence, we performed comparative analyses of transcriptomes of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) in mice that underwent 37 days of spaceflight. Results indicate shared stress responses and altered circadian rhythm. EDL showed more robust growth signals and Pde2a downregulation, possibly underlying its resistance to atrophy versus soleus. Spaceflight and hindlimb unloading mice shared differential regulation of proliferation, circadian, and neuronal signaling. Shared gene regulation in muscles of humans on bedrest and space flown rodents suggest targets for mitigating muscle atrophy in space and on Earth. Spaceflight responses of C. elegans were more similar to EDL. Discrete life stages of D. melanogaster have distinct utility in anticipating EDL and soleus responses. In summary, spaceflight leads to shared and discrete molecular responses between muscle types and invertebrate models may augment mechanistic knowledge gained from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies.

However, the specific physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space flight and/or ground-based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study, high aspect ratio vessel S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles, H 2 O 2 resistance, and competence in sucrose-containing biofilm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H 2 O 2 compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated ≥2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated ≥2-fold during simulated microgravity high aspect ratio vessel growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses.

This experiment used Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) to grow asynchronous ground control and spaceflight cultures of S. aureus for 48 h. RNAIII, the effector of the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, was the most highly upregulated gene transcript in spaceflight relative to ground controls. The agr operon gene transcripts were also highly upregulated during spaceflight, followed by genes encoding phenol-soluble modulins and secreted proteases, which are positively regulated by Agr. Upregulated spaceflight genes/proteins also had functions related to urease activity, type VII-like Ess secretion, and copper transport. We also performed secretome analysis of BRIC-23 culture supernatants, which revealed that spaceflight samples had increased abundance of secreted virulence factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), and EsxA (secreted by the Ess system). These data also indicated that S. aureus metabolism is altered in spaceflight conditions relative to the ground controls.

Homotypic vacuole fusion requires VTI11 and is regulated by phosphoinositides,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6126739/,"Significance Plant vacuoles are essential organelles and occupy up to 90% of the cell volume. Their roles include regulation of stomata movements, protein storage in seeds, gravity sensing, and ion homeostasis. Vacuole or lysosome fusion in eukaryotes is mediated by two multisubunit complexes, SNARE and homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS), but only the SNARE complex is well characterized in plants. Here, we show that, similar to other eukaryotes, HOPS mediates vacuole fusion in plants by interaction with SNAREs and that the HOPS subunit VPS33 and the SNARE protein SYP22 display the sites for interaction between these complexes. In contrast to other eukaryotes, however, plant HOPS recruitment to liposomes is inhibited by phosphoinositides, which appear to define strict rules for regulating fusion and fragmentation of dynamic vacuoles.

REGULATOR OF BULB BIOGENESIS1 (RBB1) Is Involved in Vacuole Bulb Formation in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411111/,"Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant fluctuations and transient structures such as trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs. Bulbs are highly dynamic spherical structures inside vacuoles that are formed by multiple layers of membranes and are continuous with the main tonoplast. We recently carried out a screen for mutants with abnormal trafficking to the vacuole or aberrant vacuole morphology. We characterized regulator of bulb biogenesis1-1 ( rbb1-1 ), a mutant in Arabidopsis that contains increased numbers of bulbs when compared to the parental control. rbb1-1 mutants also contain fewer transvacuolar strands than the parental control, and we propose the hypothesis that the formation of transvacuolar strands and bulbs is functionally related. We propose that the bulbs may function transiently to accommodate membranes and proteins when transvacuolar strands fail to elongate. We show that RBB1 corresponds to a very large protein of unknown function that is specific to plants, is present in the cytosol, and may associate with cellular membranes.

Microgravity enhances the phenotype of Arabidopsis zigzag-1 and reduces the Wortmannin-induced vacuole fusion in root cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9445043/,"The spaceflight environment of the International Space Station poses a multitude of stresses on plant growth including reduced gravity. Plants exposed to microgravity and other conditions on the ISS display root skewing, changes in gene expression and protein abundance that may result in changes in cell wall composition, antioxidant accumulation and modification of growth anisotropy. Systematic studies that address the effects of microgravity on cellular organelles are lacking but altered numbers and sizes of vacuoles have been detected in previous flights. The prominent size of plant vacuoles makes them ideal models to study organelle dynamics in space. Here, we used Arabidopsis zigzag-1 ( zig-1 ) as a sensitized genotype to study the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion. Wortmannin was used to induce vacuole fusion in seedlings and a formaldehyde-based fixation protocol was developed to visualize plant vacuole morphology after sample return, using confocal microscopy. Our results indicate that microgravity enhances the zig-1 phenotype by reducing hypocotyl growth and vacuole fusion in some cells.

Hypergravity disruption of homeorhetic adaptations to lactation in rat dams include changes in circadian clocks,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3509447/,"Summary Altered gravity load induced by spaceflight (microgravity) and centrifugation (hypergravity) is associated with changes in circadian, metabolic, and reproductive systems. Exposure to 2-g hypergravity (HG) during pregnancy and lactation decreased rate of mammary metabolic activity and increased pup mortality. We hypothesize HG disrupted maternal homeorhetic responses to pregnancy and lactation are due to changes in maternal metabolism, hormone concentrations, and maternal behavior related to gravity induced alterations in circadian clocks. Effect of HG exposure on mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism, plasma hormones and maternal behavior were analyzed in rat dams from mid-pregnancy (Gestational day [G]11) through early lactation (Postnatal day [P]3); comparisons were made across five time-points: G20, G21, P0 (labor and delivery), P1 and P3. Blood, mammary, liver, and adipose tissue were collected for analyzing plasma hormones, glucose oxidation to CO 2 and incorporation into lipids, or gene expression. Maternal behavioral phenotyping was conducted using time-lapse videographic analyses. Dam and fetal-pup body mass were significantly reduced in HG in all age groups. HG did not affect labor and delivery; however, HG pups experienced a greater rate of mortality. PRL, corticosterone, and insulin levels and receptor genes were altered by HG. Mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism and expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolism were altered by HG exposure. Exposure to HG significantly changed expression of core clock genes in mammary and liver and circadian rhythms of maternal behavior.

Here, we measured methylation of DNA associated with the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene, a gene important in development and plasticity, and telomere length in the brains of adult rat male and female offspring whose mothers were exposed to unpredictable and variable stressors throughout gestation. Males exposed to prenatal stress had greater methylation ( Bdnf IV ) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to non-stressed male controls and stressed females. Further, prenatally-stressed animals had shorter telomeres than controls in the mPFC.

However, how male and female muscle may respond differently to micro- and partial-gravity environments is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how biological sex and sex steroid hormones influence the progression of muscle atrophy after long term exposure to micro and partial gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and female Fisher rats ( n ​= ​120) underwent either castration/ovariectomy or sham surgeries. After two weeks recovery, animals were divided into microgravity (0g), partial-gravity (40% of weight bearing, 0.4g), or full weight bearing (1g) interventions for 28 days. Measurements of muscle size and strength were evaluated prior to and after interventions. At 0g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle size compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Additionally, at 0.4g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle strength compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Females have greater musculoskeletal aberrations during exposure to both microgravity and partial-gravity environments; these differences are not dependent on the presence of sex steroid hormones.

Among these proteins, annexin 1 (AtANN1) was one of those up-regulated rapidly after heat-shock treatment. Functional studies show loss-of-function mutants for AtANN1 and its close homolog AtANN2 were more sensitive to heat-shock treatment, whereas plants overexpressing AtANN1 showed more resistance to this treatment. Correspondingly, the heat-induced expression of heat-shock proteins and heat-shock factors is inhibited in ann1/ann2 double mutant, and the heat-activated increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ) is greatly impaired in the ann1 mutant and almost undetectable in ann1/ann2 double mutant.

Apyrase inhibitors enhance the ability of diverse fungicides to inhibit the growth of different plant-pathogenic fungi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6638264/,"Summary A previous study has demonstrated that the treatment of Arabidopsis plants with chemical inhibitors of apyrase enzymes increases their sensitivity to herbicides. In this study, we found that the addition of the same or related apyrase inhibitors could potentiate the ability of different fungicides to inhibit the growth of five different pathogenic fungi in plate growth assays. The growth of all five fungi was partially inhibited by three commonly used fungicides: copper octanoate, myclobutanil and propiconazole. However, when these fungicides were individually tested in combination with any one of four different apyrase inhibitors (AI.1, AI.10, AI.13 or AI.15), their potency to inhibit the growth of five fungal pathogens was increased significantly relative to their application alone. The apyrase inhibitors were most effective in potentiating the ability of copper octanoate to inhibit fungal growth, and least effective in combination with propiconazole. Among the five pathogens assayed, that most sensitive to the fungicide‐potentiating effects of the inhibitors was Sclerotinia sclerotiorum . Overall, among the 60 treatment combinations tested (five pathogens, four apyrase inhibitors, three fungicides), the addition of apyrase inhibitors increased significantly the sensitivity of fungi to the fungicide treatments in 53 of the combinations. Consistent with their predicted mode of action, inhibitors AI.1, AI.10 and AI.13 each increased the level of propiconazole retained in one of the fungi, suggesting that they could partially block the ability of efflux transporters to remove propiconazole from these fungi.

Mitochondria-targeted human catalase in the mouse longevity MCAT model mitigates head-tilt bedrest-induced neuro-inflammation in the hippocampus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9695374/,"Microgravity (modeled by head-tilt bedrest and hind-limb unloading), experienced during prolonged spaceflight, results in neurological consequences, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and potentially impairment during the performance of critical tasks. Similar pathologies are observed in bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and muscle disuse on Earth. In our previous study, we saw that head-tilt bedrest together with social isolation upregulated the milieu of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma. These changes were mitigated in a MCAT mouse model overexpressing human catalase in the mitochondria, pointing out the importance of ROS signaling in this stress response. Here, we used a head-tilt model in socially housed mice to tease out the effects of head-tilt bedrest without isolation. In order to find the underlying molecular mechanisms that provoked the cytokine response, we measured CD68, an indicator of microglial activation in the hippocampus, as well as changes in normal in-cage behavior. We hypothesized that hindlimb unloading (HU) will elicit microglial hippocampal activations, which will be mitigated in the MCAT ROS-quenching mice model. Indeed, we saw an elevation of the activated microglia CD68 marker following HU in the hippocampus, and this pathology was mitigated in MCAT mice. Additionally, we identified cytokines in the hippocampus, which had significant positive correlations with CD68 and negative correlations with exploratory behaviors, indicating a link between neuroinflammation and behavioral consequences. Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment and prevention of cognitive changes following long space missions and/or muscle disuse on Earth.

To do so, we examined skeletal phenotypes in end-stage (16-week-old) SOD1 G93A female mice and healthy littermate female controls (N=9–10/group). Outcomes included trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture by microcomputed tomography; stiffness and strength via three-point bending; resistance to crack growth by fracture toughness testing; and cortical bone matrix properties via cyclic reference point indentation. SOD1 G93A mice had similar bone size, but significantly lower trabecular bone mass (−54%), thinner trabeculae (−41%) and decreased cortical bone thickness (−17%) and cortical area (−18%) compared to control mice (all p<0.01).

Dose-dependent skeletal deficits due to varied reductions in mechanical loading in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7235020/,"Reduced skeletal loading leads to marked bone loss. Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks ( n = 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone.

Approaching Gravity as a Continuum Using the Rat Partial Weight-Bearing Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7599661/,"For decades, scientists have relied on animals to understand the risks and consequences of space travel. Animals remain key to study the physiological alterations during spaceflight and provide crucial information about microgravity-induced changes. While spaceflights may appear common, they remain costly and, coupled with limited cargo areas, do not allow for large sample sizes onboard. In 1979, a model of hindlimb unloading (HU) was successfully created to mimic microgravity and has been used extensively since its creation. Four decades later, the first model of mouse partial weight-bearing (PWB) was developed, aiming at mimicking partial gravity environments. Return to the Lunar surface for astronauts is now imminent and prompted the need for an animal model closer to human physiology; hence in 2018, our laboratory created a new model of PWB for adult rats. In this review, we will focus on the rat model of PWB, from its conception to the current state of knowledge. Additionally, we will address how this new model, used in conjunction with HU, will help implement new paradigms allowing scientists to anticipate the physiological alterations and needs of astronauts. Finally, we will discuss the outstanding questions and future perspectives in space research and propose potential solutions using the rat PWB model.

Hindlimb suspension in Wistar rats: Sex-based differences in muscle response,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8493566/,"Ground‐based animal models have been used extensively to understand the effects of microgravity on various physiological systems. Among them, hindlimb suspension (HLS), developed in 1979 in rats, remains the gold‐standard and allows researchers to study the consequences of total unloading of the hind limbs while inducing a cephalic fluid shift. While this model has already brought valuable insights to space biology, few studies have directly compared functional decrements in the muscles of males and females during HLS. We exposed 28 adult Wistar rats (14 males and 14 females) to 14 days of HLS or normal loading (NL) to better assess how sex impacts disuse‐induced muscle deconditioning. Females better maintained muscle function during HLS than males, as shown by a more moderate reduction in grip strength at 7 days (males: −37.5 ± 3.1%, females: −22.4 ± 6.5%, compared to baseline), that remains stable during the second week of unloading (males: −53.3 ± 5.7%, females: −22.4 ± 5.5%, compared to day 0) while the males exhibit a steady decrease over time (effect of sex × loading p = 0.0002, effect of sex × time × loading p = 0.0099). This was further supported by analyzing the force production in response to a tetanic stimulus. Further functional analyses using force production were also shown to correspond to sex differences in relative loss of muscle mass and CSA. Moreover, our functional data were supported by histomorphometric analyzes, and we highlighted differences in relative muscle loss and CSA. Specifically, female rats seem to experience a lesser muscle deconditioning during disuse than males thus emphasizing the need for more studies that will assess male and female animals concomitantly to develop tailored, effective countermeasures for all astronauts.

Effects of liquid cultivation on gene expression and phenotype of C. elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6069985/,"Background Liquid cultures have been commonly used in space, toxicology, and pharmacology studies of Caenorhabditis elegans . However, the knowledge about transcriptomic alterations caused by liquid cultivation remains limited. Moreover, the impact of different genotypes in rapid adaptive responses to environmental changes (e.g., liquid cultivation) is often overlooked. Here, we report the transcriptomic and phenotypic responses of laboratory N2 and the wild-isolate AB1 strains after culturing P 0 worms on agar plates, F 1 in liquid cultures, and F 2 back on agar plates. Results Significant variations were found in the gene expressions between the N2 and AB1 strains in response to liquid cultivation. The results demonstrated that 8–34% of the environmental change-induced transcriptional responses are transmitted to the subsequent generation. By categorizing the gene expressions for genotype, environment, and genotype-environment interactions, we identified that the genotype has a substantial impact on the adaptive responses. Functional analysis of the transcriptome showed correlation with phenotypical changes. For example, the N2 strain exhibited alterations in both phenotype and gene expressions for germline and cuticle in axenic liquid cultivation. We found transcript evidence to approximately 21% of the computationally predicted genes in C. elegans by exposing the worms to environmental changes. Conclusions The presented study reveals substantial differences between N2 and AB1 strains for transcriptomic and phenotypical responses to rapid environmental changes.

Transcriptomic Signature of the Simulated Microgravity Response in Caenorhabditis elegans and Comparison to Spaceflight Experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9856674/,"Given the growing interest in human exploration of space, it is crucial to identify the effects of space conditions on biological processes. Here, we analyze the transcriptomic response of Caenorhabditis elegans to simulated microgravity and observe the maintained transcriptomic response after returning to ground conditions for four, eight, and twelve days. We show that 75% of the simulated microgravity-induced changes on gene expression persist after returning to ground conditions for four days while most of these changes are reverted after twelve days. Our results from integrative RNA-seq and mass spectrometry analyses suggest that simulated microgravity affects longevity-regulating insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling pathways.

Enabling clonal analyses of yeast in outer space by encapsulation and desiccation in hollow microparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9410522/,"Studying microbes at the single-cell level in space can accelerate human space exploration both via the development of novel biotechnologies and via the understanding of cellular responses to space stressors and countermeasures. High-throughput technologies for screening natural and engineered cell populations can reveal cellular heterogeneity and identify high-performance cells. Here, we present a method to desiccate and preserve microbes in nanoliter-scale compartments, termed PicoShells, which are microparticles with a hollow inner cavity. In PicoShells, single cells are confined in an inner aqueous core by a porous hydrogel shell, allowing the diffusion of nutrients, wastes, and assay reagents for uninhibited cell growth and flexible assay protocols. Desiccated PicoShells offer analysis capabilities for single-cell derived colonies with a simple, low resource workflow, requiring only the addition of water to rehydrate hundreds of thousands of PicoShells and the single microbes encapsulated inside. Our desiccation method results in the recovery of desiccated microparticle morphology and porosity after a multi-week storage period and rehydration, with particle diameter and porosity metrics changing by less than 18% and 7%, respectively, compared to fresh microparticles. We also recorded the high viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast desiccated and rehydrated inside PicoShells, with only a 14% decrease in viability compared to non-desiccated yeast over 8.5 weeks, although we observed an 85% decrease in initial growth potential over the same duration. We show a proof-of-concept for a growth rate-based analysis of single-cell derived colonies in rehydrated PicoShells, where we identified 11% of the population that grows at an accelerated rate. Desiccated PicoShells thus provide a robust method for cell preservation before and during launch, promising a simple single-cell analysis method for studying heterogeneity in microbial populations in space.

Dried plum diet protects from bone loss caused by ionizing radiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4750446/,"Bone loss caused by ionizing radiation is a potential health concern for radiotherapy patients, radiation workers and astronauts. In animal studies, exposure to ionizing radiation increases oxidative damage in skeletal tissues, and results in an imbalance in bone remodeling initiated by increased bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Therefore, we evaluated various candidate interventions with antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activities (antioxidant cocktail, dihydrolipoic acid, ibuprofen, dried plum) both for their ability to blunt the expression of resorption-related genes in marrow cells after irradiation with either gamma rays (photons, 2 Gy) or simulated space radiation (protons and heavy ions, 1 Gy) and to prevent bone loss. Dried plum was most effective in reducing the expression of genes related to bone resorption ( Nfe2l2, Rankl, Mcp1, Opg, TNF-α ) and also preventing later cancellous bone decrements caused by irradiation with either photons or heavy ions. Thus, dietary supplementation with DP may prevent the skeletal effects of radiation exposures either in space or on Earth.",bone loss caused ionizing radiation potential health concern radiotherapy patients radiation workers astronauts animal studies exposure ionizing radiation increases oxidative damage skeletal tissues results imbalance bone remodeling initiated increased boneresorbing osteoclasts therefore evaluated various candidate interventions antioxidant antiinflammatory activities antioxidant cocktail dihydrolipoic acid ibuprofen dried plum ability blunt expression resorptionrelated genes marrow cells irradiation either gamma rays photons simulated space radiation protons heavy ions prevent bone loss dried plum effective reducing expression genes related bone resorption nfel rankl mcp opg tnf also preventing later cancellous bone decrements caused irradiation either photons heavy ions thus dietary supplementation may prevent skeletal effects radiation exposures either space earth
Dietary countermeasure mitigates simulated spaceflight-induced osteopenia in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162976/,"Spaceflight is a unique environment that includes at least two factors which can negatively impact skeletal health: microgravity and ionizing radiation. We have previously shown that a diet supplemented with dried plum powder (DP) prevented radiation-induced bone loss in mice. In this study, we investigated the capacity of the DP diet to prevent bone loss in mice following exposure to simulated spaceflight, combining microgravity (by hindlimb unloading) and radiation exposure. The DP diet was effective at preventing most decrements in bone micro-architectural and mechanical properties due to hindlimb unloading alone and simulated spaceflight. Furthermore, we show that the DP diet can protect osteoprogenitors from impairments resulting from simulated microgravity.

Simulated microgravity alters gene regulation linked to immunity and cardiovascular disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11353732/,"Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.

Autophagy and its consequences for platelet biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11953390/,"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a multifaceted and gradually advancing condition characterized by a complex pathogenesis. The current therapeutic options for CKD remain limited in efficacy. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD are of paramount importance. We identified cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) with potential as drug targets from the eQTLGen Consortium database to serve as the exposure. For the outcome, we utilized a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the FinnGen database, which comprised a case group of 11,265 individuals and a control group of 436,208 individuals. MR analysis was employed to investigate druggable genes closely associated with CKD. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional roles of these significant genes. Finally, a colocalization analysis was conducted to determine the likelihood that a cis-eQTL for a druggable gene and CKD share a causal variant. The expression of 12 genes was found to be significantly associated with CKD risk, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these genes are primarily involved in the regulation of MAP kinase activity, regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity, Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway. The colocalization analysis results suggested that CKD and the TUBB gene may share a causal variant, with a posterior probability (PP.H4) exceeding 80% (TUBB: 97.27%). Compelling statistical evidence indicates that TUBB represents the most promising pharmacological target for the treatment of CKD.

A new role of NAP1L1 in megakaryocytes and human platelets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9737020/,"Platelets (PLTs) are anucleate and considered incapable of nuclear functions. Contrastingly, nuclear proteins were detected in human PLTs. For most of these proteins, it is unclear if nuclear or alternatively assigned functions are performed, a question we wanted to address for n uclear a ssembly p rotein 1 l ike 1 (NAP1L1). Using a wide array of molecular methods, including RNAseq, co-IP, overexpression and functional assays, we explored expression pattern and functionality of NAP1L1 in PLTs, and CD34 + -derived megakaryocytes (MKs). NAP1L1 is expressed in PLTs and MKs. Co-IP experiments revealed that dihydrolipolylysine-residue acetyltransferase (DLAT encoded protein PDC-E2, ODP2) dynamically interacts with NAP1L1. PDC-E2 is part of the mitochondrial pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) multi-enzyme complex, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular respiration, and promoting ATP-synthesis via the respiratory chain. Since altered mitochondrial function is a hallmark of infectious syndromes, we analyzed PDH activity in PLTs from septic patients demonstrating increased activity, paralleling NAP1L1 expression levels. MKs PDH activity decreased following an LPS-challenge. Furthermore, overexpression of NAP1L1 significantly altered the ability of MKs to form proplatelet extensions, diminishing thrombopoiesis. These results indicate that NAP1L1 performs in other than nucleosome-assembly functions in PTLs and MKs, binding a key mitochondrial protein as a potential chaperone, and gatekeeper, influencing PDH activity and thrombopoiesis.

While several biofilm forming species, including Penicillium rubens , have been identified in spacecraft, the effect of microgravity on fungal biofilm formation is unknown. This study sent seven material surfaces (Stainless Steel 316, Aluminum Alloy, Titanium Alloy, Carbon Fiber, Quartz, Silicone, and Nanograss) inoculated with spores of P. rubens to the International Space Station and allowed biofilms to form for 10, 15, and 20 days to understand the effects of microgravity on biofilm morphology and growth. In general, microgravity did not induce changes in the shape of biofilms, nor did it affect growth in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage. However, microgravity increased or decreased biofilm formation in some cases, and this was incubation-time- and material-dependent. Nanograss was the material with significantly less biofilm formation, both in microgravity and on Earth, and it could potentially be interfering with hyphal adhesion and/or spore germination. Additionally, a decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days, potentially due to nutrient depletion, was seen in some space and Earth samples and was material-dependent.

Explainable machine learning identifies multi-omics signatures of muscle response to spaceflight in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10719374/,"The adverse effects of microgravity exposure on mammalian physiology during spaceflight necessitate a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms to develop effective countermeasures. One such concern is muscle atrophy, which is partly attributed to the dysregulation of calcium levels due to abnormalities in SERCA pump functioning. To identify potential biomarkers for this condition, multi-omics data and physiological data available on the NASA Open Science Data Repository (osdr.nasa.gov) were used, and machine learning methods were employed. Specifically, we used multi-omics (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA methylation) data and calcium reuptake data collected from C57BL/6 J mouse soleus and tibialis anterior tissues during several 30+ day-long missions on the international space station. The QLattice symbolic regression algorithm was introduced to generate highly explainable models that predict either experimental conditions or calcium reuptake levels based on multi-omics features.

Microbial adaptation to spaceflight is correlated with bacteriophage-encoded functions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11096397/,"Evidence from the International Space Station suggests microbial populations are rapidly adapting to the spacecraft environment; however, the mechanism of this adaptation is not understood. Bacteriophages are prolific mediators of bacterial adaptation on Earth. Here we survey 245 genomes sequenced from bacterial strains isolated on the International Space Station for dormant (lysogenic) bacteriophages. Our analysis indicates phage-associated genes are significantly different between spaceflight strains and their terrestrial counterparts. In addition, we identify 283 complete prophages, those that could initiate bacterial lysis and infect additional hosts, of which 21% are novel. These prophage regions encode functions that correlate with increased persistence in extreme environments, such as spaceflight, to include antimicrobial resistance and virulence, DNA damage repair, and dormancy.

MARSBOx: Fungal and bacterial endurance from a balloon-flown analog mission in the stratosphere,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7937622/,"Whether terrestrial life can withstand the martian environment is of paramount interest for planetary protection measures and space exploration. To understand microbial survival potential in Mars-like conditions, several fungal and bacterial samples were launched in September 2019 on a large NASA scientific balloon flight to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km altitude) where radiation levels resembled values at the equatorial Mars surface. Fungal spores of Aspergillus niger and bacterial cells of Salinisphaera shabanensis , Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis , and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 were launched inside the MARSBOx (Microbes in Atmosphere for Radiation, Survival, and Biological Outcomes Experiment) payload filled with an artificial martian atmosphere and pressure throughout the mission profile. The dried microorganisms were either exposed to full UV-VIS radiation (UV dose = 1148 kJ m −2 ) or were shielded from radiation. After the 5-h stratospheric exposure, samples were assayed for survival and metabolic changes. Spores from the fungus A. niger and cells from the Gram-(–) bacterium S. shabanensis were the most resistant with a 2- and 4-log reduction, respectively. Exposed Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 was completely inactivated (both with and without UV exposure) and S. capitis subsp. capitis only survived the UV shielded experimental condition (3-log reduction).

In situ linkage of fungal and bacterial proliferation to microbiologically influenced corrosion in B20 biodiesel storage tanks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7055474/,"Renewable fuels hold great promise for the future yet their susceptibility to biodegradation and subsequent corrosion represents a challenge that needs to be directly assessed. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that is widely used as a substitute or extender for petroleum diesel and is composed of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters derived from plant or animal fats. Biodiesel can be blended up to 20% v/v with ultra-low sulfur diesel (i.e., B20) and used interchangeably with diesel engines and infrastructure. The addition of biodiesel, however, has been linked to increased susceptibility to biodegradation. Microorganisms proliferating via degradation of biodiesel blends have been linked to microbiologically influenced corrosion in the laboratory, but not measured directly in storage tanks (i.e., in situ ). To measure in situ microbial proliferation, fuel degradation and microbially influenced corrosion, we conducted a yearlong study of B20 storage tanks in operation at two locations, identified the microorganisms associated with fuel fouling, and measured in situ corrosion. The bacterial populations were more diverse than the fungal populations, and largely unique to each location. The bacterial populations included members of the Acetobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae , and Proteobacteria. The abundant Eukaryotes at both locations consisted of the same taxa, including a filamentous fungus within the family Trichocomaceae , not yet widely recognized as a contaminant of petroleum fuels, and the Saccharomycetaceae family of yeasts. Increases in the absolute and relative abundances of the Trichocomaceae were correlated with significant, visible fouling and pitting corrosion. This study identified the relationship between fouling of B20 with increased rates of corrosion and the microorganisms responsible, largely at the bottom of the sampled storage tanks. To our knowledge this is the first in situ study of this scale incorporating community and corrosion measurements in an active biodiesel storage environment.

Nature of pre-earthquake phenomena and their effects on living organisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4494396/,"Simple Summary Earthquakes are invariably preceded by a period when stresses increase deep in the Earth. Animals appear to be able to sense impending seismic events. During build-up of stress, electronic charge carriers are activated deep below, called positive holes. Positive holes have unusual properties: they can travel fast and far into and through the surrounding rocks. As they flow, they generate ultralow frequency electromagnetic waves. When they arrive at the Earth surface, they can ionize the air. When they flow into water, they oxidize it to hydrogen peroxides. All these physical and chemical processes can have noticeable effects on animals. Abstract Earthquakes occur when tectonic stresses build up deep in the Earth before catastrophic rupture. During the build-up of stress, processes that occur in the crustal rocks lead to the activation of highly mobile electronic charge carriers. These charge carriers are able to flow out of the stressed rock volume into surrounding rocks. Such outflow constitutes an electric current, which generates electromagnetic (EM) signals. If the outflow occurs in bursts, it will lead to short EM pulses. If the outflow is continuous, the currents may fluctuate, generating EM emissions over a wide frequency range. Only ultralow and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) waves travel through rock and can reach the Earth surface. The outflowing charge carriers are (i) positively charged and (ii) highly oxidizing. When they arrive at the Earth surface from below, they build up microscopic electric fields, strong enough to field-ionize air molecules. As a result, the air above the epicentral region of an impending major earthquake often becomes laden with positive airborne ions. Medical research has long shown that positive airborne ions cause changes in stress hormone levels in animals and humans. In addition to the ULF/ELF emissions, positive airborne ions can cause unusual reactions among animals. When the charge carriers flow into water, they oxidize water to hydrogen peroxide. This, plus oxidation of organic compounds, can cause behavioral changes among aquatic animals.

The rapid diagnosis and effective inhibition of coronavirus using spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8323809/,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease that began in 2019 (COVID-19), has been responsible for 1.4 million deaths worldwide as of 13 November 2020. Because at the time of writing no vaccine is yet available, a rapid diagnostic assay is very urgently needed. Herein, we present the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for the rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or virus via a simple colorimetric change observation within a 5 minute time period. For rapid and highly sensitive identification, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using 4-aminothiophenol as a reporter molecule, which is attached to the gold nanoparticle via an Au–S bond. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation, changing color from pink to blue, which allows for the determination of the presence of antigen or virus very rapidly by the naked eye, even at concentrations of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus. Importantly, the aggregated gold nanoparticles form “hot spots” to provide very strong SERS signal enhancement from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles via light–matter interactions. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles form aggregates. Using a portable Raman analyzer, our reported data demonstrate that our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at a concentration of 18 virus particles per mL within a 5 minute time period. Using HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells, we show that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to inhibit infection by the virus. Our reported data show that antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors, which stops virus infection and spread.

Blocking SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain binding with the ACE2 receptor of the host cell and inhibiting virus infections using human host defense peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8886715/,"The emergence of

immune system of the human body can control the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Herein, we report for the first time that human host defense neutrophil
α-defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide-conjugated
graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent the delta
variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta
variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding
with host cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Experimental
data shows that due to the binding between the delta variant spike
protein RBD and bioconjugate GQDs, in the presence of the delta variant
spike protein, the fluorescence signal from GQDs quenched abruptly.
Experimental quenching data shows a nonlinear Stern–Volmer
quenching profile, which indicates multiple binding sites. Using the
modified Hill equation, we have determined n = 2.6
and the effective binding affinity 9 nM, which is comparable with
the ACE2–spike protein binding affinity (8 nM). Using the alpha,
beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, experimental data shows that the
binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those
for the other variants. Further investigation using the HEK293T-human
ACE2 cell line indicates that peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability
for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions

Safety and pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered heparin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8890767/,"Purpose Intranasally administered unfractionated heparin (UFH) and other sulfated polysaccharides are potential prophylactics for COVID-19. The purpose of this research was to measure the safety and pharmacokinetics of clearance of intranasally administered UFH solution from the nasal cavity. Methods Double-blinded daily intranasal dosing in C57Bl6 mice with four doses (60 ng to 60 μg) of UFH was carried out for fourteen consecutive days, with both blood coagulation measurements and subject adverse event monitoring. The pharmacokinetics of fluorescent-labeled UFH clearance from the nasal cavity were measured in mice by in vivo imaging. Intranasal UFH at 2000 U/day solution with nasal spray device was tested for safety in a small number of healthy human subjects. Results UFH showed no evidence of toxicity in mice at any dose measured. No significant changes were observed in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, or frequency of minor irritant events over vehicle-only control. Human subjects showed no significant changes in aPTT time, international normalized ratio (INR), or platelet count over baseline measurements. No serious adverse events were observed. In vivo imaging in a mouse model showed a single phase clearance of UFH from the nasal cavity. After 12 h, 3.2% of the administered UFH remained in the nasal cavity, decaying to background levels by 48 h. Conclusions UFH showed no toxic effects for extended daily intranasal dosing in mice as well as humans. The clearance kinetics of intranasal heparin solution from the nasal cavity indicates potentially protective levels for up to 12 h after dosing.

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) strains by marine sulfated glycans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9487896/,"The Coronavirus disease pandemic has steered the global therapeutic research efforts toward the discovery of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) molecules. The role of the viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) has been clearly established in SARS-CoV-2 infection through its capacity to bind to the host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. The antiviral strategies targeting these 2 virus receptors are currently under intense investigation. However, the rapid evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has resulted in numerous mutations in the S-protein posing a significant challenge for the design of S-protein-targeted inhibitors. As an example, the 2 key mutations in the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), L452R, and T478K in the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) confer tighter binding to the host epithelial cells. Marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) demonstrate excellent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 via competitive disruption of the S-protein RBD-HSPG interactions and thus have the potential to be developed into effective prophylactic and therapeutic molecules. In this study, 7 different MSGs were evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a virus entry assay utilizing a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus coated with S-protein of the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) or the Delta (B.1.617.2) strain. Although all tested MSGs showed strong inhibitory activity against both strains, no correlations between MSG structural features and virus inhibition could be drawn.

Inhibition of Cytomegalovirus by Pentacta pygmaea Fucosylated Chondroitin Sulfate Depends on Its Molecular Weight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10142442/,"Many viruses attach to host cells by first interacting with cell surface proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains and then by engaging with specific receptor, resulting in virus entry. In this project, HS–virus interactions were targeted by a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) in order to block human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into cells. Human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with HCMV in the presence of PpFucCS and its low molecular weight (LMW) fractions and the virus yield at five days post-infection was assessed. The virus attachment and entry into the cells were visualized by labeling the purified virus particles with a self-quenching fluorophore octadecyl rhodamine B (R18). The native PpFucCS exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HCMV specifically blocking virus entry into the cell and the inhibitory activities of the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional to their chain lengths. PpFucCS and the derived oligosaccharides did not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity; moreover, they protected the infected cells from virus-induced lytic cell death. In conclusion, PpFucCS inhibits the entry of HCMV into cells and the high MW of this carbohydrate is a key structural element to achieve the maximal anti-viral effect. This new marine sulfated glycan can be developed into a potential prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agent against HCMV infection.

Effect of simulated cosmic radiation on cytomegalovirus reactivation and lytic replication,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11477029/,"Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects.

Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137 Cs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members.

Effects of spaceflight on the muscles of the murine shoulder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6343501/,"The musculoskeletal system is sensitive to its loading environment; this is of particular concern under conditions such as disuse, paralysis, and extended-duration space flight. Although structural and mechanical changes to tendon and bone following paralysis and disuse are well understood, there is a pressing need to understand how this unloading affects the bone-tendon interface (enthesis); the location most prone to tears and injury. We therefore elucidated these effects of unloading in the entheses of adult mice shoulders that were paralyzed for 21 days by treatment with botulinum toxin A. Unloading significantly increased the extent of mechanical failure and was associated with structural changes across hierarchical scales. At the millimeter scale, unloading caused bone loss. At the micrometer scale, unloading decreased bioapatite crystal size and crystallographic alignment in the enthesis. At the nanometer scale, unloading induced compositional changes that stiffened the bioapatite/collagen composite tissue. Mathematical modeling and mechanical testing indicated that these factors combined to increase local elevations of stress while decreasing the ability of the tissue to absorb energy prior to failure, thereby increasing injury risk.

Multiscale effects of spaceflight on murine tendon and bone,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138367/,"Despite a wealth of data on the effects of spaceflight on tendons and bones, little is known about its effects on the interfacial tissue between these two structures, the enthesis. Mice were sent to space on three separate missions: STS-131, STS-135, and Bion-M1 to determine how spaceflight affects the composition, structure, mechanics, and gene expression of the humerus-supraspinatus and calcaneus-Achilles entheses. At the nanoscale, spaceflight resulted in decreased carbonate levels in the bone, likely due to increased remodeling, as suggested by increased expression of genes related to osteoclastogenesis ( CatK , Tnfsf11) and mature osteoblasts ( Col1 , Osc) . Tendons showed a shift in collagen fibril size towards smaller diameters that may have resulted from increased expression of genes related to collagen degradation ( Mmp3, Mmp13) . These nanoscale changes did not result in micro- and milliscale changes to the structure and mechanics of the enthesis. There were no changes in bone volume, trabecular structure, failure load, or stiffness with spaceflight. This lack of tissue-level change may be anatomy based, as extremities may be less sensitive to spaceflight than central locations such as vertebrae, yet results highlight that the tendon enthesis may be robust against negative effects of spaceflight.

Reproducible changes in the gut microbiome suggest a shift in microbial and host metabolism during spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6689164/,"Background Space environment imposes a range of challenges to mammalian physiology and the gut microbiota, and interactions between the two are thought to be important in mammalian health in space. While previous findings have demonstrated a change in the gut microbial community structure during spaceflight, specific environmental factors that alter the gut microbiome and the functional relevance of the microbiome changes during spaceflight remain elusive. Methods We profiled the microbiome using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in fecal samples collected from mice after a 37-day spaceflight onboard the International Space Station. We developed an analytical tool, named STARMAPs (Similarity Test for Accordant and Reproducible Microbiome Abundance Patterns), to compare microbiome changes reported here to other relevant datasets. We also integrated the gut microbiome data with the publically available transcriptomic data in the liver of the same animals for a systems-level analysis. Results We report an elevated microbiome alpha diversity and an altered microbial community structure that were associated with spaceflight environment. Using STARMAPs, we found the observed microbiome changes shared similarity with data reported in mice flown in a previous space shuttle mission, suggesting reproducibility of the effects of spaceflight on the gut microbiome. However, such changes were not comparable with those induced by space-type radiation in Earth-based studies. We found spaceflight led to significantly altered taxon abundance in one order, one family, five genera, and six species of microbes. This was accompanied by a change in the inferred microbial gene abundance that suggests an altered capacity in energy metabolism. Finally, we identified host genes whose expression in the liver were concordantly altered with the inferred gut microbial gene content, particularly highlighting a relationship between host genes involved in protein metabolism and microbial genes involved in putrescine degradation. Conclusions These observations shed light on the specific environmental factors that contributed to a robust effect on the gut microbiome during spaceflight with important implications for mammalian metabolism. Our findings represent a key step toward a better understanding the role of the gut microbiome in mammalian health during spaceflight and provide a basis for future efforts to develop microbiota-based countermeasures that mitigate risks to crew health during long-term human space expeditions.

Failure to Generate Bone Marrow Adipocytes Does Not Protect Mice from Ovariectomy-Induced Osteopenia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564669/,"A reciprocal association between bone marrow fat and bone mass has been reported in ovariectomized rodents, suggesting that bone marrow adipogenesis has a negative effect on bone growth and turnover balance. Mice with loss of function mutations in kit receptor ( kit W/W-v ) have no bone marrow adipocytes in tibia or lumbar vertebra. We therefore tested the hypothesis that marrow fat contributes to development of osteopenia by comparing the skeletal response to ovariectomy (ovx) in growing wild type (WT) and bone marrow adipocyte-deficient kit W/W-v mice. Mice were ovx at 4 weeks of age and sacrificed 4 or 10 weeks post-surgery. Body composition was measured at necropsy by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Cortical (tibia) and cancellous (tibia and lumbar vertebra) bone architecture were evaluated by microcomputed tomography. Bone marrow adipocyte size and density, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters, and bone formation were determined by histomorphometry. Ovx resulted in an increase in total body fat mass at 10 weeks post-ovx in both genotypes, but the response was attenuated in the in kit W/W-v mice. Adipocytes were present in bone marrow of tibia and lumbar vertebra in WT mice and bone marrow adiposity increased following ovx. In contrast, marrow adipocytes were not detected in either intact or ovx kit W/W-v mice. However, ovx in WT and kit W/W-v mice resulted in statistically indistinguishable changes in cortical and cancellous bone mass, cortical and cancellous bone formation rate, and cancellous osteoblast and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters. In conclusion, our findings do not support a causal role for increased bone marrow fat as a mediator of ovx-induced osteopenia in mice.

Acute exposure to high dose gamma-radiation results in transient activation of bone lining cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4042434/,"The present studies investigated the cellular mechanisms for the detrimental effects of high dose whole body γ-irradiation on bone. In addition, radioadaptation and bone marrow transplantation were assessed as interventions to mitigate the skeletal complications of irradiation. Increased trabecular thickness and separation and reduced fractional cancellous bone volume, connectivity density, and trabecular number were detected in proximal tibia and lumbar vertebra 14 days following γ-irradiation with 6 Gy. To establish the cellular mechanism for the architectural changes, vertebrae were analyzed by histomorphometry 1, 3, and 14 days following irradiation. Marrow cell density decreased within 1 day (67% reduction, p<0.0001), reached a minimum value after 3 days (86% reduction, p<0.0001), and partially rebounded by 14 days (30% reduction, p=0.0025) following irradiation. In contrast, osteoblast-lined bone perimeter was increased by 290% (1 day, p=0.04), 1230% (3 days, p<0.0001), and 530% (14 days, p=0.003), respectively. There was a strong association between radiation-induced marrow cell death and activation of bone lining cells to express the osteoblast phenotype (Pearson correlation −0.85, p<0.0001). An increase (p=0.004) in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter was also detected with irradiation. A priming dose of γ-radiation (0.5 mGy), previously shown to reduce mortality, had minimal effect on the cellular responses to radiation and did not prevent detrimental changes in bone architecture. Bone marrow transplantation normalized marrow cell density, bone turnover, and most indices of bone architecture following irradiation. In summary, radiation-induced death of marrow cells is associated with 1) a transient increase in bone formation due, at least in part, to activation of bone lining cells, and 2) an increase in bone resorption due to increased osteoclast perimeter. Bone marrow transplantation is effective in mitigating the detrimental effects of acute exposure to high dose whole body γ-radiation on bone turnover.

Morbid obesity attenuates the skeletal abnormalities associated with leptin deficiency in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4161659/,"Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are morbidly obese and exhibit low total bone mass and mild osteopetrosis. In order to disassociate the skeletal effects of leptin deficiency from those associated with morbid obesity, we evaluated bone mass, architecture, gene expression, and indices of bone turnover in wild type (WT) mice, ob/ob mice fed ad libitum ( ob/ob ) , and ob/ob mice pair fed to WT mice (pair-fed ob/ob ). Mice were maintained at 32°C (thermoneutral) from 6 to 18 weeks of age to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure. ob/ob mice were heavier, had more abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT), and were hyperglycemic compared to WT mice. Femur length, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density, and midshaft femur cortical thickness were lower in ob/ob mice than in WT mice. Cancellous bone volume fraction was higher but indices of bone formation and resorption were lower in ob/ob compared to WT mice; reduced bone resorption in ob/ob mice resulted in pathological retention of calcified cartilage. Pair-fed ob/ob mice were lighter, had lower WAT, uterine weight, and serum glucose than ob/ob mice. Similarly, femoral length, BMC, and cortical thickness were lower in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared to ob/ob mice, as were indices of cancellous bone formation and resorption. In contrast, bone marrow adiposity, calcified cartilage and cancellous bone volume fraction were higher at one or more cancellous sites in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared to ob/ob mice.

Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy reduces body weight without accelerating age-related bone loss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4917201/,"Excessive weight gain in adults is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes. Unfortunately, dieting, exercise, and pharmacological interventions have had limited long-term success in weight control and can result in detrimental side effects, including accelerating age-related cancellous bone loss. We investigated the efficacy of using hypothalamic leptin gene therapy as an alternative method for reducing weight in skeletally-mature (9-month-old) female rats and determined the impact of leptin-induced weight loss on bone mass, density, and microarchitecture, and serum biomarkers of bone turnover (CTx and osteocalcin). Rats were implanted with cannulae in the 3rd ventricle of the hypothalamus and injected with either recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding the gene for rat leptin (rAAV-Leptin, n=7) or a control vector encoding green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP, n=10) and sacrificed 18 weeks later. A baseline control group (n=7) was sacrificed at vector administration. rAAV-Leptin-treated rats lost weight (−4±2%) while rAAV-GFP-treated rats gained weight (14±2%) during the study. At study termination, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats weighed 17% less than rAAV-GFP-treated rats and had lower abdominal white adipose tissue weight (−80%), serum leptin (−77%), and serum IGF1 (−34%). Cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis, and in lumbar vertebra tended to be lower (p<0.1) in rAAV-GFP-treated rats (13.5-months-old) compared to baseline control rats (9-months-old). Significant differences in cancellous bone or biomarkers of bone turnover were not detected between rAAV-Leptin and rAAV-GFP rats. In summary, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats maintained a lower body weight compared to baseline and rAAV-GFP-treated rats with minimal effects on bone mass, density, microarchitecture, or biochemical markers of bone turnover.

Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy Reduces Bone Marrow Adiposity in ob/ob Mice Fed Regular and High-Fat Diets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4985531/,"Low bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) progenitor, adipocyte formation may increase at the expense of osteoblast formation. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone known to regulate energy and bone metabolism. Leptin deficiency and high-fat diet-induced obesity are associated with increased marrow adipose tissue (MAT) and reduced bone formation. Short-duration studies suggest that leptin treatment reduces MAT and increases bone formation in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice fed a regular diet. Here, we determined the long-duration impact of increased hypothalamic leptin on marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts in ob/ob mice following recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy. Eight- to 10-week-old male ob/ob mice were randomized into four groups: (1) untreated, (2) rAAV-Lep, (3) rAAV-green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP), or (4) pair-fed to rAAV-Lep. For vector administration, mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with either rAAV-leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep) or rAAV-GFP (9 × 10 7 particles) and maintained for 30 weeks. In a second study, the impact of increased hypothalamic leptin levels on MAT was determined in mice fed high-fat diets; ob/ob mice were randomized into two groups and treated with either rAAV-Lep or rAAV-GFP. At 7 weeks post-vector administration, half the mice in each group were switched to a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Wild-type (WT) controls included age-matched mice fed regular or high-fat diet. High-fat diet resulted in a threefold increase in MAT in WT mice, whereas MAT was increased by leptin deficiency up to 50-fold. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoblast perimeter and osteoclast perimeter with minor change in cancellous bone architecture. The gene therapy decreased MAT levels in ob/ob mice fed regular or high-fat diet to values similar to WT mice fed regular diet. These findings suggest that leptin plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes and osteoblasts, a process that may be dysregulated by high-fat diet. However, the results also illustrate that reducing MAT by increasing leptin levels does not necessarily result in increased bone mass.

Room temperature housing results in premature cancellous bone loss in growing female mice: implications for the mouse as a preclinical model for age-related bone loss.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5421618/,"Purpose Female mice are often used as preclinical models for osteoporosis but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss during growth. Mice are routinely housed at room temperature (18–23°C), a strategy that exaggerates physiological differences in thermoregulation between mice (obligatory daily heterotherms) and humans (homeotherms). The purpose of this investigation was to assess whether housing female mice at thermoneutral (temperature range where the basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss) alters bone growth, turnover and microarchitecture. Methods Growing (4-week-old) female C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mice were housed at either 22 °C or 32°C for up to 18 weeks. Results C57BL/6J mice housed at 22°C experienced a 62% cancellous bone loss from the distal femur metaphysis during the interval from 8–18 weeks of age and lesser bone loss from the distal femur epiphysis, whereas cancellous and cortical bone mass in 32°C-housed mice were unchanged or increased. The impact of thermoneutral housing on cancellous bone was not limited to C57BL/6J mice as C3H/HeJ mice exhibited a similar skeletal response. The beneficial effects of thermoneutral housing on cancellous bone were associated with decreased Ucp1 gene expression in brown adipose tissue, increased bone marrow adiposity, higher rates of bone formation, higher expression levels of osteogenic genes and locally decreased bone resorption. Conclusions Housing female mice at 22°C resulted in premature cancellous bone loss.

Spaceflight-induced vertebral bone loss in ovariectomized rats is associated with increased bone marrow adiposity and no change in bone formation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515514/,"There is often a reciprocal relationship between bone marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts, suggesting that marrow adipose tissue (MAT) antagonizes osteoblast differentiation. MAT is increased in rodents during spaceflight but a causal relationship between MAT and bone loss remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Twelve-week-old OVX Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to a ground control or flight group. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar vertebrae ( n =11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. Compared with ground controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts.",often reciprocal relationship bone marrow adipocytes osteoblasts suggesting marrow adipose tissue mat antagonizes osteoblast differentiation mat increased rodents spaceflight causal relationship mat bone loss remains unclear present study evaluated effects day spaceflight bone mass bone resorption bone formation mat lumbar vertebrae ovariectomized ovx rats twelveweekold ovx fischer rats randomly assigned ground control flight group following flight histological sections second lumbar vertebrae group stained using technique allowed simultaneous quantification cells preflight fluorochrome label compared ground controls rats flown space lower cancellous bone area higher mat increased adiposity due increase adipocyte number size mineral apposition rate osteoblast turnover unchanged spaceflight contrast resorption preflight fluorochrome osteoclastlined bone perimeter increased respectively present findings indicate cancellous bone loss rat lumbar vertebrae spaceflight accompanied increased bone resorption mat change bone formation findings support hypothesis increased mat spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity lifespan however context ovarian hormone deficiency bone formation spaceflight insufficient balance increased resorption indicating defective coupling results therefore consistent hypothesis spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells diverted adipocytes expense forming osteoblasts
Role of oestrogen receptor signaling in skeletal response to leptin in female ob/ob mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8671758/,"The absence of leptin results in contrasting growth pattern of appendicular and axial bone growth in ob/ob mice. Endochondral bone formation is an important procedure of growth plate determining the bone growth, where this procedure is also regulated by estrogen and its receptor (ER) signaling pathway. The present study is undertaken to explore the roles of ERs in regulating the different growth patterns in ob/ob mice. In this study, C57BL/6 female mice were used as wild-type (WT) mice; ob/ob mice and WT mice were age-matched fed, and bone length is analyzed by X-ray plain film at the 12 weeks old. We confirm that ob/ob mice have shorter femoral length and longer spine length than WT mice ( p < 0.05). The contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proliferation proteins and hypertrophic marker proteins are also observed from the femur and spinal growth plate of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice ( p < 0.01). Spearman’s analysis showed that body length (axial and appendicular length) is positively related to the expression level of ERα in growth plate. Three-week-old female ob/ob mice are randomized divided into three groups: 1) ob/ob + ctrl, 2) ob/ob + ERα antagonist (MPP), and 3) ob/ob + ERβ antagonist (PHTPP). Age-matched C57BL/6 mice were also divided into three groups, same as the groups of ob/ob mice. MPP and PHTPP were administered by intraperitoneal injection for 6 weeks. However, the results of X-ray and H&E staining demonstrate that leptin deficiency seems to disturb the regulating effects of ER antagonists on longitudinal bone growth. These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ERα might be associated with contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in ob/ob mice. However, ER signaling on longitudinal bone growth was blunted by leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice, and the underlying association between ERs and leptin needs to be explored in future work.

Effects of hypothalamic leptin gene therapy on osteopetrosis in leptin-deficient mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771473/,"Impaired resorption of cartilage matrix deposited during endochondral ossification is a defining feature of juvenile osteopetrosis. Growing, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice exhibit a mild form of osteopetrosis. However, the extent to which the disease is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin treatment is unknown. We addressed the first question by performing histomorphometric analysis of femurs in rapidly growing (2-month-old), slowly growing (4-month-old), and skeletally mature (6-month-old) wild type (WT) and ob/ob male mice. Absent by 6 months of age in WT mice, cartilage matrix persisted to varying extents in distal femur epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis in ob/ob mice, suggesting that the osteopetrotic phenotype is not entirely self-limiting. To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy to restore leptin signaling in ob/ob mice. Two-month-old mice were randomized to one of three groups: (1) untreated control, (2) rAAV-Leptin, or (3) control vector rAAV-green fluorescent protein and vectors injected intracerebroventricularly. Seven months later, rAAV-Leptin-treated mice exhibited no cartilage in the metaphysis and greatly reduced cartilage in the epiphysis and diaphysis.

Leptin stimulates bone formation in ob/ob mice at doses having minimal impact on energy metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5288125/,"Leptin, the protein product of the ob gene, is essential for normal bone growth, maturation, and turnover. Peripheral actions of leptin occur at lower serum levels of the hormone than central actions because entry of leptin into the central nervous system (CNS) is limited due to its saturable transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We performed a study in mice to model the impact of leptin production associated with different levels of adiposity on bone formation and compared the response with well-established centrally-mediated actions of the hormone on energy metabolism. Leptin was infused (0, 4, 12, 40, 140, or 400 ng/h) for 12 days into 6-week-old female ob/ob mice (n=8/group) using sc implanted osmotic pumps. Treatment resulted in a dose-associated increase in serum leptin. Bone formation parameters were increased at EC 50 infusion rates of 7–17 ng/h whereas higher levels (EC 50 , 40–80 ng/h) were required to similarly impact indices of energy metabolism. We then analyzed gene expression in tibia and hypothalamus at dose rates of 0, 12 and 140 ng/h; the latter dose resulted in serum leptin levels similar to WT mice. Infusion with 12 ng/h leptin increased expression of genes associated with Jak/Stat signaling and bone formation in tibia with minimal effect on Jak/Stat signaling and neurotransmitters in hypothalamus. The results suggest that leptin acts peripherally to couple bone acquisition to energy availability and that limited transport across the BBB insures that the growth promoting actions of peripheral leptin are not curtailed by the hormone’s CNS-mediated anorexigenic actions.

Parallel to systemic metabolic alterations and hematopoietic cell proliferation, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding increases the expression of Mrc1 in sinusoidal ECs, thus calling for the investigation of its role in bone marrow cell reprogramming and the metabolic profile during obesity. Mrc1 −/− mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were fed an HFD (45% Kcal/diet) for 20 weeks. Weight gain was monitored during the diet regimen and glucose and insulin tolerance were assessed. Extensive flow cytometry profiling, histological, and proteomic analyses were performed. After HFD feeding, Mrc1 −/− mice presented impaired medullary hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid progenitors and mature cells in parallel with an increase in BM adipocytes compared to controls. Accordingly, circulating levels of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes decreased in Mrc1 −/− mice together with reduced infiltration of macrophages in the visceral adipose tissue and the liver compared to controls. Liver histological profiling coupled with untargeted proteomic analysis revealed that Mrc1 −/− mice presented decreased liver steatosis and the downregulation of proteins belonging to pathways involved in liver dysfunction. This profile was reflected by improved glucose and insulin response and reduced weight gain during HFD feeding in Mrc1 −/− mice compared to controls.

Maintenance of near normal bone mass and architecture in lethally irradiated female mice following adoptive transfer with as few as 750 purified hematopoietic stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6548323/,"Total-body irradiation (TBI) followed by transfer of bone marrow cells from donors is routinely performed in immunology research and can be used to manipulate differentiation and/or function of bone cells. However, exposure to high-dose radiation can result in irreversible osteopenia, and transfer of heterogeneous cell populations can complicate interpretation of results. The goal of this research was to establish an approach for reconstituting bone marrow using small numbers of purified donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without negatively affecting bone metabolism. Gamma-irradiated (9 Gy) WBB6F1 mice were engrafted with bone marrow cells (5 × 10 6 cells) or purified HSCs (3,000 cells) obtained from GFP transgenic mice. In vivo analysis and in vitro differentiation assays performed two months later established that both methods were effective in reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment with donor-derived cells. We confirmed these findings by engrafting C57Bl/6 (B6) mice with bone marrow cells or purified HSCs from CD45.1 B6 congenic mice. We next performed adoptive transfer of purified HSCs (750 cells) into WBB6F1 and radiosensitive Kit W/W-v mice and evaluated the skeleton two months later. Minimal differences were observed between controls and WBB6F1-engrafted mice that received fractionated doses of 2 × 5 Gy. Kit w/wv mice lost weight and became osteopenic after 2 × 5 Gy irradiations but these abnormalities were negligible after 5 Gy irradiation. Importantly, adoptive transfer of wild-type cells into Kit w/wv mice restored normal Kit expression in bone marrow. Together, these findings provide strong evidence for efficient engraftment with purified HSCs after lethal TBI with minimal collateral damage to bone. This approach will be useful for investigating mechanisms by which hematopoietic lineage cells regulate bone metabolism.",totalbody irradiation tbi followed transfer bone marrow cells donors routinely performed immunology research used manipulate differentiation andor function bone cells however exposure highdose radiation result irreversible osteopenia transfer heterogeneous cell populations complicate interpretation results goal research establish approach reconstituting bone marrow using small numbers purified donorderived hematopoietic stem cells hscs without negatively affecting bone metabolism gammairradiated wbbf mice engrafted bone marrow cells cells purified hscs cells obtained gfp transgenic mice vivo analysis vitro differentiation assays performed two months later established methods effective reconstituting hematopoietic compartment donorderived cells confirmed findings engrafting cbl mice bone marrow cells purified hscs congenic mice next performed adoptive transfer purified hscs cells wbbf radiosensitive kit wwv mice evaluated skeleton two months later minimal differences observed controls wbbfengrafted mice received fractionated doses kit wwv mice lost weight became osteopenic irradiations abnormalities negligible irradiation importantly adoptive transfer wildtype cells kit wwv mice restored normal kit expression bone marrow together findings provide strong evidence efficient engraftment purified hscs lethal tbi minimal collateral damage bone approach useful investigating mechanisms hematopoietic lineage cells regulate bone metabolism
Effect of leptin deficiency on the skeletal response to hindlimb unloading in adult male mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6597714/,"Based on body weight, morbidly obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice have less bone than expected, suggesting that leptin plays a role in the skeletal response to weight bearing. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the skeletal response of wild type (WT) and ob/ob mice to hindlimb unloading (HU). Mice were individually housed at 32 °C (thermoneutral) from 4 weeks of age (rapidly growing) to 16 weeks of age (approaching skeletal maturity). Mice were then randomized into one of 4 groups (n = 10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3) ob/ob control, and (4) ob/ob HU and the results analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. ob/ob mice pair-fed to WT mice had normal cancellous bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in distal femur, lower femur length and total bone area, mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD), and higher cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra (LV). HU resulted in lower BMC and BMD in total femur, and lower BV/TV in distal femur and LV in both genotypes. Cancellous bone loss in femur in both genotypes was associated with increases in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter.

Thermoneutral housing attenuates premature cancellous bone loss in male C57BL/6J mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6865368/,"Mice are a commonly used model to investigate aging-related bone loss but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss prior to skeletal maturity. The mechanisms mediating premature bone loss are not well established. However, our previous work in female mice suggests housing temperature is a critical factor. Premature cancellous bone loss was prevented in female C57BL/6J mice by housing the animals at thermoneutral temperature (where basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss). In the present study, we determined if the protective effects of thermoneutral housing extend to males. Male C57BL/6J mice were housed at standard room temperature (22°C) or thermoneutral (32°C) conditions from 5 (rapidly growing) to 16 (slowly growing) weeks of age. Mice housed at room temperature exhibited reductions in cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and fifth lumbar vertebra; these effects were abolished at thermoneutral conditions. Mice housed at thermoneutral temperature had higher levels of bone formation in distal femur (based on histomorphometry) and globally (serum osteocalcin), and lower global levels of bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) compared to mice housed at room temperature. Thermoneutral housing had no impact on bone marrow adiposity but resulted in higher abdominal white adipose tissue and serum leptin. The overall magnitude of room temperature housing-induced cancellous bone loss did not differ between male (current study) and female (published data) mice. These findings highlight housing temperature as a critical experimental variable in studies using mice of either sex to investigate aging-related changes in bone metabolism.

Effects of Spaceflight on Cancellous and Cortical Bone in Proximal Femur in Growing Rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7907224/,"Mechanical loading of the skeleton during normal weight bearing plays an important role in bone accrual and turnover balance. We recently evaluated bone microarchitecture in the femoral head in 5.6-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats subjected to a 4-day spaceflight aboard STS-41. Compared to weight bearing ground controls, cancellous bone volume fraction was dramatically lower in animals subjected to microgravity. The effects of spaceflight on the rat skeleton are potentially influenced by factors such as age, duration of flight, strain and sex. To test the generalizability of our initial observation, we evaluated archived proximal femora from two additional spaceflight missions: a 10-day mission (STS-57) with 7.5-week-old male Fisher 344 rats, and a 14-day mission (STS-62) with 12-week-old ovariectomized (ovx) female Fisher 344 rats. Cancellous microarchitecture and cortical thickness were assessed using x-ray microtomography/microcomputed tomography. In male rats, cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume) was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls, but differences were not significant compared to baseline. In ovx female rats, cancellous bone volume fraction was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls and baseline, indicating net bone loss. Cortical thickness did not differ among groups in either experiment. In summary, findings from three separate studies support the conclusion that spaceflight results in cancellous osteopenia in femoral head of growing rats.

Leptin and environmental temperature as determinants of bone marrow adiposity in female mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9582271/,"Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) levels are higher in distal femur metaphysis of female mice housed at thermoneutral (32°C) than in mice housed at 22°C, as are abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, and serum leptin levels. We performed two experiments to explore the role of increased leptin in temperature-enhanced accrual of BMAT. First, we supplemented 6-week-old female C57BL/6J (B6) mice with leptin for 2 weeks at 10 µg/d using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump. Controls consisted of ad libitum ( ad lib ) fed mice and mice pair fed to match food intake of leptin-supplemented mice. The mice were maintained at 32°C for the duration of treatment. At necropsy, serum leptin in leptin-supplemented mice did not differ from ad lib mice, suggesting suppression of endogenous leptin production. In support, Ucp1 expression in BAT, percent body fat, and abdominal WAT mass were lower in leptin-supplemented mice. Leptin-supplemented mice also had lower BMAT and higher bone formation in distal femur metaphysis compared to the ad lib group, changes not replicated by pair-feeding. In the second experiment, BMAT response was evaluated in 6-week-old female B6 wild type (WT), leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin-treated (0.3 μg/d) ob/ob mice housed at 32°C for the 2-week duration of the treatment. Compared to mice sacrificed at baseline (22°C), BMAT increased in ob/ob mice as well as WT mice, indicating a leptin independent response to increased temperature. However, infusion of ob/ob mice with leptin, at a dose rate having negligible effects on either energy metabolism or serum leptin levels, attenuated the increase in BMAT. In summary, increased housing temperature and increased leptin have independent but opposing effects on BMAT in mice.

Small changes in thermoregulation influence cancellous bone turnover balance in distal femur metaphysis in growing female mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10063413/,"Mice are typically housed at temperatures well below their thermoneutral zone. When individually housed at room temperature (~22 °C) mice experience cold stress which results in cancellous bone loss and has the potential to alter the skeletal response to treatment. It is not clear if there is a threshold temperature for cold stress-induced bone loss. It is also not clear if alternative strategies for attenuating cold stress, such as group housing, influence bone accrual and turnover. This study aimed to determine how small differences in temperature (4 °C) or heat loss (individual versus group housing with nestlets) influence bone in growing female C57BL/6 J mice. Five-week-old mice were randomized by weight to 1 of 4 treatment groups (N = 10/group): 1) baseline, 2) single housed at 22 °C, 3) single housed at 26 °C, or 4) group housed (n = 5/cage) with nestlets at 22 °C. Mice in the baseline group were sacrificed 1 week later, at 6 weeks of age. The other 3 groups of mice were maintained at their respective temperatures and housing conditions for 13 weeks until 18 weeks of age. Compared to baseline, mice single housed at room temperature had increased body weight and femur size, but dramatically decreased cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis. The cancellous bone loss was attenuated but not prevented in mice individually housed at 26 °C or group housed at 22 °C.

Irradiation was followed by adoptive transfer of 1000 purified WT hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The extent of immune reconstitution in blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes in the irradiated mice was determined using HSCs from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing mice. We also evaluated skeletal response to treatment. Detection of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral blood at 4 and 9 weeks following adoptive transfer and in bone marrow and lymph nodes following necropsy revealed excellent immune reconstitution in both WT and BMAT-deficient mice. Adipocytes were numerous in the distal femur of WT mice but absent or rare in Kit W/W-v mice. Bone parameters, including length, mass, density, bone volume, microarchitecture, and turnover balance, exhibited few differences between WT and BMAT-deficient mice. The minimal differences suggest that BMAT is not required for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal radiation and is not a major contributor to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling-deficient mice.

Simulated Microgravity Promotes Horizontal Gene Transfer of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes between Bacterial Genera in the Absence of Antibiotic Selective Pressure,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8468678/,"Bacteria are able to adapt and survive in harsh and changing environments through many mechanisms, with one of them being horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This process is one of the leading culprits in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within bacterial communities and could pose a significant health threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions. In order to better understand the degree of HGT activity that could occur in space, biosafety level-2, donor and recipient bacteria were co-cultured under simulated microgravity (SMG) on Earth with concomitant 1G controls. Two AMR genes, bla OXA-500 and ISAba1, from the donor Acinetobacter pittii, were tracked in four recipient strains of Staphylococcus aureus (which did not harbor those genes) using polymerase chain reaction. All four S. aureus strains that were co-cultured with A. pittii under SMG had a significantly higher number of isolates that were now bla OXA-500 - and ISAba1 -positive compared to growth at 1G. The acquisition of these genes by the recipient induced a phenotypic change, as these isolates were now resistant to oxacillin, which they were previously susceptible to.

Locomotion of this model organism is used to assess muscular and neural defects and score impacts of genetic mutations and pharmacological interventions. Existing analyses of the nematode gait have been focused on 2D locomotion, and 3D motion remains largely unexplored. We identify and mathematically describe a unique 3D behavioral pattern in burrowing and swimming—a roll maneuver—which, in combination with 2D turns, allows the nematode to explore bulk media.

Microfluidic Device for Studying Nematodes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12021249/,"The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been routinely used to study gene functions, genetic interactions, and conserved signaling pathways. Most experiments require that the animals are synchronized to be at the same specific developmental stage. Bleach synchronization is traditionally used to obtain a population of staged embryos, but the method can have harmful effects on the embryos. The physical separation of differently sized animals is preferred but often difficult to perform because some developmental stages are the same sizes as others. Microfluidic device filters have been used as alternatives, but they are expensive and require customization to scale up the preparation of staged animals. Here, we present a protocol for the synchronization of embryos using mesh filters. Using filtration, we obtained a higher yield of embryos per plate than using the standard bleach synchronization protocol and at a scale beyond microfluidic devices. Importantly, filtration has no deleterious effects on downstream larval development assays. In conclusion, we have exploited the differences in the sizes of C. elegans developmental stages to isolate embryo cultures suitable for use in high-throughput assays.",freeliving nematode caenorhabditis elegans routinely used study gene functions genetic interactions conserved signaling pathways experiments require animals synchronized specific developmental stage bleach synchronization traditionally used obtain population staged embryos method harmful effects embryos physical separation differently sized animals preferred often difficult perform developmental stages sizes others microfluidic device filters used alternatives expensive require customization scale preparation staged animals present protocol synchronization embryos using mesh filters using filtration obtained higher yield embryos per plate using standard bleach synchronization protocol scale beyond microfluidic devices importantly filtration deleterious effects downstream larval development assays conclusion exploited differences sizes elegans developmental stages isolate embryo cultures suitable use highthroughput assays
NemaFlex: A microfluidics-based technology for standardized measurement of muscular strength of C. elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6057834/,"Muscle strength is a functional measure of quality of life in humans. Declines in muscle strength are manifested in diseases as well as during inactivity, aging, and space travel. With conserved muscle biology, the simple genetic model C. elegans is a high throughput platform in which to identify molecular mechanisms causing muscle strength loss and to develop interventions based on diet, exercise, and drugs. In the clinic, standardized strength measures are essential to quantitate changes in patients; however, analogous standards have not been recapitulated in the C. elegans model since force generation fluctuates based on animal behavior and locomotion. Here, we report a microfluidics-based system for strength measurement that we call ‘NemaFlex’, based on pillar deflection as the nematode crawls through a forest of pillars. We have optimized the micropillar forest design and identified robust measurement conditions that yield a measure of strength that is independent of behavior and gait. Validation studies using a muscle contracting agent and mutants confirm that NemaFlex can reliably score muscular strength in C. elegans . Additionally, we report a scaling factor to account for animal size that is consistent with a biomechanics model and enables comparative strength studies of mutants. Taken together, our findings anchor NemaFlex for applications in genetic and drug screens, for defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function, and for dissection of degenerative processes in disuse, aging, and disease.",muscle strength functional measure quality life humans declines muscle strength manifested diseases well inactivity aging space travel conserved muscle biology simple genetic model elegans high throughput platform identify molecular mechanisms causing muscle strength loss develop interventions based diet exercise drugs clinic standardized strength measures essential quantitate changes patients however analogous standards recapitulated elegans model since force generation fluctuates based animal behavior locomotion report microfluidicsbased system strength measurement call nemaflex based pillar deflection nematode crawls forest pillars optimized micropillar forest design identified robust measurement conditions yield measure strength independent behavior gait validation studies using muscle contracting agent mutants confirm nemaflex reliably score muscular strength elegans additionally report scaling factor account animal size consistent biomechanics model enables comparative strength studies mutants taken together findings anchor nemaflex applications genetic drug screens defining molecular cellular circuits neuromuscular function dissection degenerative processes disuse aging disease
"Swim exercise in Caenorhabditis elegans extends neuromuscular and gut healthspan, enhances learning ability, and protects against neurodegeneration",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6876156/,"Significance Exercise is a powerful antiaging intervention that protects against cardiovascular disease, dementia, diabetes, sarcopenia, and cancer.

Molecular muscle experiment: Hardware and operational lessons for future astrobiology space experiments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7415877/,"Biology experiments in space seek to increase our understanding of what happens to life beyond Earth and how we can safely send life beyond Earth. Spaceflight is associated with many (mal)adaptations in physiology, including decline in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, vestibular, and immune systems. Biological experiments in space are inherently challenging to implement. Development of hardware and validation of experimental conditions are critical to ensure the collection of high-quality data. The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has been studied in space for more than 20 years to better understand spaceflight-induced (patho)physiology, particularly spaceflight-induced muscle decline. These experiments have used a variety of hardware configurations. Despite this, hardware used in the past was not available for our most recent experiment, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME). Therefore, we had to design and validate flight hardware for MME. MME provides a contemporary example of many of the challenges faced by researchers conducting C. elegans experiments onboard the International Space Station.

Tart Cherry Increases Lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans by Altering Metabolic Signaling Pathways,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7285199/,"Aging and healthspan are determined by both environmental and genetic factors. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) pathway is a key mediator of aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. Specifically, DAF-2 signaling, an ortholog of human IGF, controls DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, a master regulator of metabolism and longevity. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are both linked to aging. We propose that daily supplementation of tart cherry extract (TCE), rich in anthocyanins with antioxidant properties may exert dual benefits for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, resulting in beneficial effects on aging in C. elegans . We found that TCE supplementation at 6 μg or 12 μg/mL, increased ( p < 0.05) the mean lifespan of wild type N2 worms, respectively, when compared to untreated control worms. Consistent with these findings, TCE upregulated ( p < 0.05) expression of longevity-related genes such as daf-16 and aak-2 (but not daf-2 or akt-1 genes) and genes related to oxidative stress such as sod-2 . Further, we showed that TCE supplementation increased spare respiration in N2 worms. However, TCE did not change the mean lifespan of daf-16 and aak-2 mutant worms. In conclusion, our findings indicate that TCE confers healthspan benefits in C. elegans through enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress, mainly via the DAF-16 pathway.

A region of UNC-89 (obscurin) lying between two protein kinase domains is a highly elastic spring required for proper sarcomere organization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9549344/,"In C. elegans , unc-89 encodes a set of giant multi-domain proteins (up 8,081 residues) localized to the M-lines of muscle sarcomeres and required for normal sarcomere organization and whole-animal locomotion. Multiple UNC-89 isoforms contain two protein kinase domains. There is conservation in arrangement of domains between UNC-89 and its two mammalian homologs, obscurin and SPEG: kinase, a non-domain region of 647–742 residues, Ig domain, Fn3 domain and a second kinase domain. In all three proteins, this non-domain “interkinase region” has low sequence complexity, high proline content and lacks predicted secondary structure. We report that a major portion of this interkinase (571 residues out of 647 residues) when examined by single molecule force spectroscopy in vitro displays the properties of a random coil and acts as an entropic spring. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create nematodes carrying an in-frame deletion of the same 571-residue portion of the interkinase. These animals display severe disorganization of all portions of the sarcomere in body wall muscle. Super-resolution microscopy reveals extra, short-A-bands lying close to the outer muscle cell membrane and between normally spaced A-bands. Nematodes with this in-frame deletion show defective locomotion and muscle force generation. We designed our CRISPR-generated in-frame deletion to contain an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms. This HA tag results in normal organization of body wall muscle, but approximately half the normal levels of the giant UNC-89 isoforms, dis-organization of pharyngeal muscle, small body size, and reduced muscle force, likely due to poor nutritional uptake.

NemaLife chip: a micropillar-based microfluidic culture device optimized for aging studies in crawling C. elegans,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7530743/,"In this study, we report a microfluidic device for the whole-life culture of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that allows the scoring of animal survival and health measures. This device referred to as the NemaLife chip features: (1) an optimized micropillar arena in which animals can crawl, (2) sieve channels that separate progeny and prevent the loss of adults from the arena during culture maintenance, and (3) ports that allow rapid accessibility for feeding the adult-only population and introducing reagents as needed. The pillar arena geometry was optimized to accommodate the growing body size during culture and emulate the body gait and locomotion of animals reared on agar. Likewise, feeding protocols were optimized to recapitulate longevity outcomes typical of standard plate growth. Key benefits of the NemaLife Chip include eliminating the need to perform repeated manual transfers of adults during survival assays, negating the need for progeny-blocking chemical interventions, and avoiding the swim-induced stress across lifespan in animals reared in liquid. We also show that the culture of animals in pillar-less microfluidic chambers reduces lifespan and introduces physiological stress by increasing the occurrence of age-related vulval integrity disorder. We validated our pillar-based device with longevity analyses of classical aging mutants ( daf-2 , age-1 , eat-2, and daf-16 ) and animals subjected to RNAi knockdown of age-related genes ( age-1 and daf-16 ). We also showed that healthspan measures such as pharyngeal pumping and tap-induced stimulated reversals can be scored across the lifespan in the NemaLife chip.

We found that animals that lived 5 days of adulthood on the International Space Station exhibited hyperbranching in PVD and touch receptor neurons. We also found that, in the presence of a neuronal proteotoxic stress, spaceflight promotes a remarkable accumulation of neuronal-derived waste in the surrounding tissues, suggesting an impaired transcellular degradation of debris released from neurons.

Microfluidics-integrated spaceflight hardware for measuring muscle strength of Caenorhabditis elegans on the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9640571/,"Caenorhabditis elegans is a low-cost genetic model that has been flown to the International Space Station to investigate the influence of microgravity on changes in the expression of genes involved in muscle maintenance. These studies showed that genes that encode muscle attachment complexes have decreased expression under microgravity. However, it remains to be answered whether the decreased expression leads to concomitant changes in animal muscle strength, specifically across multiple generations. We recently reported the NemaFlex microfluidic device for the measurement of muscle strength of C. elegans (Rahman et al., Lab Chip, 2018). In this study, we redesign our original NemaFlex device and integrate it with flow control hardware for spaceflight investigations considering mixed animal culture, constraints on astronaut time, crew safety, and on-orbit operations. The technical advances we have made include (i) a microfluidic device design that allows animals of a given size to be sorted from unsynchronized cultures and housed in individual chambers, (ii) a fluid handling protocol for injecting the suspension of animals into the microfluidic device that prevents channel clogging, introduction of bubbles, and crowding of animals in the chambers, and (iii) a custom-built worm-loading apparatus interfaced with the microfluidic device that allows easy manipulation of the worm suspension and prevents fluid leakage into the surrounding environment.

A Compact Imaging Platform for Conducting C. elegans Phenotypic Assays on Earth and in Spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9862956/,"The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans is used in a variety of applications ranging from fundamental biological studies, to drug screening, to disease modeling, and to space-biology investigations. These applications rely on conducting whole-organism phenotypic assays involving animal behavior and locomotion. In this study, we report a 3D printed compact imaging platform (CIP) that is integrated with a smart-device camera for the whole-organism phenotyping of C. elegans . The CIP has no external optical elements and does not require mechanical focusing, simplifying the optical configuration. The small footprint of the system powered with a standard USB provides capabilities ranging from plug-and-play, to parallel operation, and to housing it in incubators for temperature control. We demonstrate on Earth the compatibility of the CIP with different C. elegans substrates, including agar plates, liquid droplets on glass slides and microfluidic chips. We validate the system with behavioral and thrashing assays and show that the phenotypic readouts are in good agreement with the literature data. We conduct a pilot study with mutants and show that the phenotypic data collected from the CIP distinguishes these mutants. Finally, we discuss how the simplicity and versatility offered by CIP makes it amenable to future C. elegans investigations on the International Space Station, where science experiments are constrained by system size, payload weight and crew time.

Mitochondrial sulfide promotes life span and health span through distinct mechanisms in developing versus adult treated Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10410709/,"Significance Deteriorating health across the life course is a major societal burden, and effective therapeutics are lacking. Mitochondrial decline has long been associated with age-related health loss. We show that small, clinically meaningful doses of a mitochondrion-targeting sulfur donor (AP39) extend Caenorhabditis elegans health in older age, which act by maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Adult onset of AP39 delivery, when mitochondrial and cell structural dysfunction are already manifested, also promoted healthy aging. Distinct association of health span extension with mitochondria, cytoskeletal and peroxisome molecular profiles, under regulation of the elt-6 / elt-3 transcription factor regulatory circuit, further distinguished adult-onset AP39 therapy.

Bisphosphonates attenuate age-related muscle decline in Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10751425/,"Background Age‐related muscle decline (sarcopenia) associates with numerous health risk factors and poor quality of life. Drugs that counter sarcopenia without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. Recent studies suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the efficacy of bisphosphonates as an anti‐sarcopenic therapy is currently unclear. Methods Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a sarcopenia model, we treated animals with 100 nM, 1, 10, 100 and 500 μM zoledronic acid (ZA) and assessed lifespan and healthspan (movement rates) using a microfluidic chip device. The effects of ZA on sarcopenia were examined using GFP‐tagged myofibres or mitochondria at days 0, 4 and 6 post‐adulthood. Mechanisms of ZA‐mediated healthspan extension were determined using combined ZA and targeted RNAi gene knockdown across the life‐course. Results We found 100 nM and 1 μM ZA increased lifespan ( P < 0.001) and healthspan [954 ± 53 (100 nM) and 963 ± 48 (1 μM) vs. 834 ± 59% (untreated) population activity AUC, P < 0.05]. 10 μM ZA shortened lifespan ( P < 0.0001) but not healthspan (758.9 ± 37 vs. 834 ± 59, P > 0.05), whereas 100 and 500 μM ZA were larval lethal. ZA (1 μM) significantly improved myofibrillar structure on days 4 and 6 post‐adulthood (83 and 71% well‐organized myofibres, respectively, vs. 56 and 34% controls, P < 0.0001) and increased well‐networked mitochondria at day 6 (47 vs. 16% in controls, P < 0.01). Genes required for ZA‐mediated healthspan extension included fdps‐1 /FDPS‐1 (278 ± 9 vs. 894 ± 17% population activity AUC in knockdown + 1 μM ZA vs. untreated controls, respectively, P < 0.0001), daf‐16 /FOXO (680 ± 16 vs. 894 ± 17%, P < 0.01) and agxt‐2 /BAIBA (531 ± 23 vs. 552 ± 8%, P > 0.05). Life/healthspan was extended through knockdown of igdb‐1 /FNDC5 (635 ± 10 vs. 523 ± 10% population activity AUC in gene knockdown vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01) and sir‐2.3 /SIRT‐4 (586 ± 10 vs. 523 ± 10%, P < 0.05), with no synergistic improvements in ZA co‐treatment vs. knockdown alone [651 ± 12 vs. 635 ± 10% ( igdb‐1 /FNDC5) and 583 ± 9 vs. 586 ± 10% ( sir‐2.3 /SIRT‐4), both P > 0.05]. Conversely, let‐756 /FGF21 and sir‐2.2 /SIRT‐4 were dispensable for ZA‐induced healthspan [630 ± 6 vs. 523 ± 10% population activity AUC in knockdown + 1 μM ZA vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01 ( let‐756 /FGF21) and 568 ± 9 vs. 523 ± 10%, P < 0.05 ( sir‐2.2 /SIRT‐4)]. Conclusions Despite lacking an endoskeleton, ZA delays Caenorhabditis elegans sarcopenia, which translates to improved neuromuscular function across the life course.

Spaceflight Induces Strength Decline in Caenorhabditis elegans,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10605753/,"Background: Understanding and countering the well-established negative health consequences of spaceflight remains a primary challenge preventing safe deep space exploration. Targeted/personalized therapeutics are at the forefront of space medicine strategies, and cross-species molecular signatures now define the ‘typical’ spaceflight response. However, a lack of direct genotype–phenotype associations currently limits the robustness and, therefore, the therapeutic utility of putative mechanisms underpinning pathological changes in flight. Methods: We employed the worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a validated model of space biology, combined with ‘NemaFlex-S’ microfluidic devices for assessing animal strength production as one of the most reproducible physiological responses to spaceflight. Wild-type and dys-1 (BZ33) strains (a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model for comparing predisposed muscle weak animals) were cultured on the International Space Station in chemically defined media before loading second-generation gravid adults into NemaFlex-S devices to assess individual animal strength. These same cultures were then frozen on orbit before returning to Earth for next-generation sequencing transcriptomic analysis. Results: Neuromuscular strength was lower in flight versus ground controls (16.6% decline, p < 0.05), with dys-1 significantly more (23% less strength, p < 0.01) affected than wild types. The transcriptional gene ontology signatures characterizing both strains of weaker animals in flight strongly corroborate previous results across species, enriched for upregulated stress response pathways and downregulated mitochondrial and cytoskeletal processes. Functional gene cluster analysis extended this to implicate decreased neuronal function, including abnormal calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling, in space-induced strength declines under the predicted control of UNC-89 and DAF-19 transcription factors. Finally, gene modules specifically altered in dys-1 animals in flight again cluster to neuronal/neuromuscular pathways, suggesting strength loss in DMD comprises a strong neuronal component that predisposes these animals to exacerbated strength loss in space. Conclusions: Highly reproducible gene signatures are strongly associated with space-induced neuromuscular strength loss across species and neuronal changes in calcium/acetylcholine signaling require further study. These results promote targeted medical efforts towards and provide an in vivo model for safely sending animals and people into deep space in the near future.

Metabolic model predictions enable targeted microbiome manipulation through precision prebiotics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10846184/,"While numerous health-beneficial interactions between host and microbiota have been identified, there is still a lack of targeted approaches for modulating these interactions. Thus, we here identify precision prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of a microbiome member species of interest. In the first step, we show that defining precision prebiotics by compounds that are only taken up by the target species but no other species in a community is usually not possible due to overlapping metabolic niches. Subsequently, we use metabolic modeling to identify precision prebiotics for a two-member Caenorhabditis elegans microbiome community comprising the immune-protective target species Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71. We experimentally confirm four of the predicted precision prebiotics, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and γ-aminobutyric acid, to specifically increase the abundance of MYb11. L-serine was further assessed in vivo , leading to an increase in MYb11 abundance also in the worm host. Overall, our findings demonstrate that metabolic modeling is an effective tool for the design of precision prebiotics as an important cornerstone for future microbiome-targeted therapies. IMPORTANCE While various mechanisms through which the microbiome influences disease processes in the host have been identified, there are still only few approaches that allow for targeted manipulation of microbiome composition as a first step toward microbiome-based therapies. Here, we propose the concept of precision prebiotics that allow to boost the abundance of already resident health-beneficial microbial species in a microbiome. We present a constraint-based modeling pipeline to predict precision prebiotics for a minimal microbial community in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans comprising the host-beneficial Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 with the aim to boost the growth of MYb11. Experimentally testing four of the predicted precision prebiotics, we confirm that they are specifically able to increase the abundance of MYb11 in vitro and in vivo . These results demonstrate that constraint-based modeling could be an important tool for the development of targeted microbiome-based therapies against human diseases.

Identification and characterization of a skin microbiome on Caenorhabditis elegans suggests environmental microbes confer cuticle protection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11302229/,"In the wild, C. elegans are emersed in environments teeming with a veritable menagerie of microorganisms. The C. elegans cuticular surface serves as a barrier and first point of contact with their microbial environments. In this study, we identify microbes from C. elegans natural habitats that associate with its cuticle, constituting a simple “skin microbiome.” We rear our animals on a modified CeMbio, mCeMbio, a consortium of ecologically relevant microbes. We first combine standard microbiological methods with an adapted micro skin-swabbing tool to describe the skin-resident bacteria on the C. elegans surface. Furthermore, we conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies to identify relative shifts in the proportion of mCeMbio bacteria upon surface-sterilization, implying distinct skin- and gut-microbiomes. We find that some strains of bacteria, including Enterobacter sp. JUb101 , are primarily found on the nematode skin, while others like Stenotrophomonas indicatrix JUb19 and Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 are predominantly found in the animal’s gut. Finally, we show that this skin microbiome promotes host cuticle integrity in harsh environments. Together, we identify a skin microbiome for the well-studied nematode model and propose its value in conferring host fitness advantages in naturalized contexts. IMPORTANCE The genetic model organism C. elegans has recently emerged as a tool for understanding host–microbiome interactions. Nearly all of these studies either focus on pathogenic or gut-resident microbes. Little is known about the existence of native, nonpathogenic skin microbes or their function. We demonstrate that members of a modified C. elegans model microbiome, mCeMbio, can adhere to the animal's cuticle and confer protection from noxious environments. We combine a novel micro-swab tool, the first 16S microbial sequencing data from relatively unperturbed C. elegans , and physiological assays to demonstrate microbially mediated protection of the skin. This work serves as a foundation to explore wild C. elegans skin microbiomes and use C. elegans as a model for skin research.

Protein kinase 2 of the giant sarcomeric protein UNC-89 regulates mitochondrial morphology and function,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11487192/,"UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production.

New perspectives on viable microbial communities in low-biomass cleanroom environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3554398/,"The advent of phylogenetic DNA microarrays and high-throughput pyrosequencing technologies has dramatically increased the resolution and accuracy of detection of distinct microbial lineages in mixed microbial assemblages. Despite an expanding array of approaches for detecting microbes in a given sample, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of these cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. In this study, pre-PCR propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was coupled with downstream pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to better understand the frequency, diversity and distribution of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms. Sample fractions not treated with PMA, which were indicative of the presence of both live and dead cells, yielded a great abundance of highly diverse bacterial pyrosequences. In contrast, only 1% to 10% of all of the pyrosequencing reads, arising from a few robust bacterial lineages, originated from sample fractions that had been pre-treated with PMA. The results of PhyloChip analyses of PMA-treated and -untreated sample fractions were in agreement with those of pyrosequencing. The viable bacterial population detected in cleanrooms devoid of spacecraft hardware was far more diverse than that observed in cleanrooms that housed mission-critical spacecraft hardware. The latter was dominated by hardy, robust organisms previously reported to survive in oligotrophic cleanroom environments. Presented here are the findings of the first ever comprehensive effort to assess the viability of cells in low-biomass environmental samples, and correlate differential viability with phylogenetic affiliation.

Microbial existence in controlled habitats and their resistance to space conditions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10370681/,"Mouse models are critical tools in tuberculosis (TB) research. Recent studies have demonstrated that the wild mouse gut microbiota promotes host fitness and improves disease resistance. Here we examine whether the wild mouse gut microbiota alters the immunopathology of TB in BALB/c mice. Conventional BALB/c mice (LabC) and mice born to germ-free BALB/c mothers reconstituted with the wild mouse gut microbiota (WildR) were used in our studies. WildR mice controlled initial TB infection better than LabC mice. The microbial gut communities of LabC mice and WildR mice had similar richness but significantly different composition prior to infection. TB reduced the gut community richness in both cohorts while differences in community composition remained indicating a general TB-induced dysbiosis. The wild mouse gut microbiota did not alter the typical lung histopathology of TB in the BALB/c model that includes unstructured immune cell infiltrates with infected foamy macrophages invading alveolar spaces. Animals of both cohorts mounted robust T cell responses in lungs and spleen with lower absolute counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lungs of WildR mice during acute infection, corresponding with observed differences in pathogen load.

Microbiomes of the dust particles collected from the International Space Station and Spacecraft assembly facilities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624184/,"Background The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique built environment due to the effects of microgravity, space radiation, elevated carbon dioxide levels, and especially continuous human habitation. Understanding the composition of the ISS microbial community will facilitate further development of safety and maintenance practices. The primary goal of this study was to characterize the viable microbiome of the ISS-built environment. A second objective was to determine if the built environments of Earth-based cleanrooms associated with space exploration are an appropriate model of the ISS environment. Results Samples collected from the ISS and two cleanrooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA) were analyzed by traditional cultivation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and propidium monoazide–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. The 16S rRNA gene Illumina iTag sequencing was used to elucidate microbial diversity and explore differences between ISS and cleanroom microbiomes. Statistical analyses showed that members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were dominant in the samples examined but varied in abundance. Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS samples whereas Proteobacteria, least abundant in the ISS, dominated in the cleanroom samples. The viable bacterial populations seen by PMA treatment were greatly decreased. However, the treatment did not appear to have an effect on the bacterial composition (diversity) associated with each sampling site. Conclusions The results of this study provide strong evidence that specific human skin-associated microorganisms make a substantial contribution to the ISS microbiome, which is not the case in Earth-based cleanrooms. For example, Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium (Actinobacteria) but not Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) species are dominant on the ISS in terms of viable and total bacterial community composition. The results obtained will facilitate future studies to determine how stable the ISS environment is over time. The present results also demonstrate the value of measuring viable cell diversity and population size at any sampling site. This information can be used to identify sites that can be targeted for more stringent cleaning. Finally, the results will allow comparisons with other built sites and facilitate future improvements on the ISS that will ensure astronaut health.

Human presence impacts fungal diversity of inflated lunar/Mars analog habitat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5504618/,"Background An inflatable lunar/Mars analog habitat (ILMAH), simulated closed system isolated by HEPA filtration, mimics International Space Station (ISS) conditions and future human habitation on other planets except for the exchange of air between outdoor and indoor environments. The ILMAH was primarily commissioned to measure physiological, psychological, and immunological characteristics of human inhabiting in isolation, but it was also available for other studies such as examining its microbiological aspects. Characterizing and understanding possible changes and succession of fungal species is of high importance since fungi are not only hazardous to inhabitants but also deteriorate the habitats. Observing the mycobiome changes in the presence of human will enable developing appropriate countermeasures with reference to crew health in a future closed habitat. Results Succession of fungi was characterized utilizing both traditional and state-of-the-art molecular techniques during the 30-day human occupation of the ILMAH. Surface samples were collected at various time points and locations to observe both the total and viable fungal populations of common environmental and opportunistic pathogenic species. To estimate the cultivable fungal population, potato dextrose agar plate counts method was utilized. The internal transcribed spacer region-based iTag Illumina sequencing was employed to measure the community structure and fluctuation of the mycobiome over time in various locations. Treatment of samples with propidium monoazide (PMA; a DNA intercalating dye for selective detection of viable microbial populations) had a significant effect on the microbial diversity compared to non-PMA-treated samples. Statistical analysis confirmed that viable fungal community structure changed (increase in diversity and decrease in fungal burden) over the occupation time. Samples collected at day 20 showed distinct fungal profiles from samples collected at any other time point (before or after). Viable fungal families like Davidiellaceae , Teratosphaeriaceae , Pleosporales , and Pleosporaceae were shown to increase during the occupation time. Conclusions The results of this study revealed that the overall fungal diversity in the closed habitat changed during human presence; therefore, it is crucial to properly maintain a closed habitat to preserve it from deteriorating and keep it safe for its inhabitants. Differences in community profiles were observed when statistically treated, especially of the mycobiome of samples collected at day 20. On a genus level Epiccocum , Alternaria , Pleosporales , Davidiella , and Cryptococcus showed increased abundance over the occupation time.

Multi-drug resistant Enterobacter bugandensis species isolated from the International Space Station and comparative genomic analyses with human pathogenic strains,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6251167/,"Background The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypic properties, multiple drug resistance (MDR) gene profiles, and genes related to potential virulence and pathogenic properties of five Enterobacter bugandensis strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) were carried out and compared with genomes of three clinical strains. Whole genome sequences of ISS strains were characterized using the hybrid de novo assembly of Nanopore and Illumina reads. In addition to traditional microbial taxonomic approaches, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed to classify the phylogenetic lineage. Agar diffusion discs assay was performed to test antibiotics susceptibility. The draft genomes after assembly and scaffolding were annotated with the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology and RNAmmer servers for downstream analysis. Results Molecular phylogeny and whole genome analysis of the ISS strains with all publicly available Enterobacter genomes revealed that ISS strains were E. bugandensis and similar to the type strain EB-247 T and two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077). Comparative genomic analyses of all eight E. bungandensis strains showed, a total of 4733 genes were associated with carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496 genes), protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes). In addition, 112 genes identified in the ISS strains were involved in virulence, disease, and defense. Genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, including the MDR tripartite system were also identified in the ISS strains. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon encoding MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, which regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported in Escherichia coli K12, was also observed in the ISS strains. Conclusion Given the MDR results for these ISS Enterobacter genomes and increased chance of pathogenicity (PathogenFinder algorithm with > 79% probability), these species pose important health considerations for future missions. Thorough genomic characterization of the strains isolated from ISS can help to understand the pathogenic potential, and inform future missions, but analyzing them in in-vivo systems is required to discern the influence of microgravity on their pathogenicity.

"International Space Station conditions alter genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics in Aspergillus nidulans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9098231/,"The first global genomic, proteomic, and secondary metabolomic characterization of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans following growth onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is reported. The investigation included the A. nidulans wild-type and 3 mutant strains, two of which were genetically engineered to enhance secondary metabolite production. Whole genome sequencing revealed that ISS conditions altered the A. nidulans genome in specific regions. In strain CW12001, which features overexpression of the secondary metabolite global regulator laeA , ISS conditions induced the loss of the laeA stop codon. Differential expression of proteins involved in stress response, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis was also observed. ISS conditions significantly decreased prenyl xanthone production in the wild-type strain and increased asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001, which are deficient in a major DNA repair mechanism. These data provide valuable insights into the adaptation mechanism of A. nidulans to spacecraft environments.

Characterization of the total and viable bacterial and fungal communities associated with the International Space Station surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6452512/,"Background The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed system inhabited by microorganisms originating from life support systems, cargo, and crew that are exposed to unique selective pressures such as microgravity. To date, mandatory microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft and space stations have been conducted by traditional culture methods, although it is known that many microbes cannot be cultured with standard techniques. To fully appreciate the true number and diversity of microbes that survive in the ISS, molecular and culture-based methods were used to assess microbial communities on ISS surfaces. Samples were taken at eight pre-defined locations during three flight missions spanning 14 months and analyzed upon return to Earth. Results The cultivable bacterial and fungal population ranged from 10 4 to 10 9 CFU/m 2 depending on location and consisted of various bacterial ( Actinobacteria , Firmicutes , and Proteobacteria ) and fungal ( Ascomycota and Basidiomycota ) phyla. Amplicon sequencing detected more bacterial phyla when compared to the culture-based analyses, but both methods identified similar numbers of fungal phyla. Changes in bacterial and fungal load (by culture and qPCR) were observed over time but not across locations. Bacterial community composition changed over time, but not across locations, while fungal community remained the same between samplings and locations. There were no significant differences in community composition and richness after propidium monoazide sample treatment, suggesting that the analyzed DNA was extracted from intact/viable organisms. Moreover, approximately 46% of intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured. Conclusions The results reveal a diverse population of bacteria and fungi on ISS environmental surfaces that changed over time but remained similar between locations. The dominant organisms are associated with the human microbiome and may include opportunistic pathogens. This study provides the first comprehensive catalog of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA requirements for deep space human habitation. The results of this study can have significant impact on our understanding of other confined built environments on the Earth such as clean rooms used in the pharmaceutical and medical industries.

Assessing the risk of transfer of microorganisms at the International Space Station due to cargo delivery by commercial resupply vehicles,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7677455/,"Background With increasing numbers of interplanetary missions, there is a need to establish robust protocols to ensure the protection of extraterrestrial planets being visited from contamination by terrestrial life forms. The current study is the first report comparing the commercial resupply vehicle (CRV) microbiome with the International Space Station (ISS) microbiome to understand the risks of contamination, thus serving as a model system for future planetary missions. Results Samples obtained from the internal surfaces and ground support equipment of three CRV missions were subjected to various molecular techniques for microbial diversity analysis. In total, 25 samples were collected with eight defined locations from each CRV mission prior to launch. In general, the internal surfaces of vehicles were clean, with an order of magnitude fewer microbes compared to ground support equipment. The first CRV mission had a larger microbial population than subsequent CRV missions, which were clean as compared to the initial CRV locations sampled. Cultivation assays showed the presence of Actinobacteria , Proteobacteria , Firmicutes , and Bacteroidetes and members of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota . As expected, shotgun metagenome analyses revealed the presence of more microbial taxa compared to cultivation-based assays. The internal locations of the CRV microbiome reportedly showed the presence of microorganisms capable of tolerating ultraviolet radiation (e.g., Bacillus firmus ) and clustered separately from the ISS microbiome. Conclusions The metagenome sequence comparison of the CRV microbiome with the ISS microbiome revealed significant differences showing that CRV microbiomes were a negligible part of the ISS environmental microbiome. These findings suggest that the maintenance protocols in cleaning CRV surfaces are highly effective in controlling the contaminating microbial population during cargo transfer to the ISS via the CRV route.

"Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov., isolated from the International Space Station",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8005752/,"Four strains belonging to the family of Methylobacteriaceae were isolated from different locations on the International Space Station (ISS) across two consecutive flights. Of these, three were identified as Gram-negative, rod-shaped, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile bacteria, designated as IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, whereas the fourth was identified as Methylorubrum rhodesianum . The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains, designated as IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, was <99.4% for 16S rRNA genes and <97.3% for gyrB gene, with the closest being Methylobacterium indicum SE2.11 T . Furthermore, the multi-locus sequence analysis placed these three ISS strains in the same clade of M. indicum. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of these three ISS strains were <93% and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were <46.4% with any described Methylobacterium species. Based on the ANI and dDDH analyses, these three ISS strains were considered as novel species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. The three ISS strains showed 100% ANI similarity and dDDH values with each other, indicating that these three ISS strains, isolated during various flights and from different locations, belong to the same species. These three ISS strains were found to grow optimally at temperatures from 25 to 30°C, pH 6.0 to 8.0, and NaCl 0 to 1%. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains resemble M. aquaticum and M. terrae since they assimilate similar sugars as sole carbon substrate when compared to other Methylobacterium species. Fatty acid analysis showed that the major fatty acid produced by the ISS strains are C 18 : 1 −ω7 c and C 18 : 1 −ω6 c . The predominant quinone was ubiquinone 10, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified lipid. Therefore, based on genomic, phylogenetic, biochemical, and fatty acid analyses, strains IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, are assigned to a novel species within the genus Methylobacterium , and the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed.

Advances in Space Microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12034939/,"Most natural populations are genetically diverse. Understanding how diversity is maintained and distributed across time and space can provide insights into the potential for evolution and extinction of populations. Immunogenetic diversity aids individuals and populations in resisting infectious disease, with many studies linking resistance to genes encoding adaptive immune responses, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The MHC is particularly important for advancing our understanding of local adaptive processes and host–parasite interactions. Here, we review the emerging work and theory exploring the geographic and temporal patterns of MHC diversity in the wild and how they are shaped by selective and demographic processes. We discuss patterns of variation along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients and place this in the context of Latitude Diversity Gradient and Central Marginal Theories. We emphasize how MHC diversity is often lower at the edges of species distributions, particularly in high‐latitude and high‐altitude regions. We also discuss MHC diversity in natural populations facing climate change. As climate change accelerates and emerging parasites spread, reduced immunogenetic diversity could severely threaten wildlife populations, compromising their resilience and long‐term survival. We propose that including immunogenetic diversity into a larger database of environmental and parasite data would allow biologists to test hypotheses regarding host–parasite coevolution and develop effective measures for conservation.

Effects of simulated microgravity on the proteome and secretome of the polyextremotolerant black fungus Knufia chersonesos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8012687/,"Black fungi are a group of melanotic microfungi characterized by remarkable polyextremotolerance. Due to a broad ecological plasticity and adaptations at the cellular level, it is predicted that they may survive in a variety of extreme environments, including harsh niches on Earth and Mars, and in outer space. However, the molecular mechanisms aiding survival, especially in space, are yet to be fully elucidated. Based on these premises, the rock-inhabiting black fungus Knufia chersonesos (Wt) and its non-melanized mutant (Mut) were exposed to simulated microgravity—one of the prevalent features characterizing space conditions—by growing the cultures in high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs). Qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on the mycelia and supernatant of culture medium (secretome) to assess alterations in cell physiology in response to low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) and to ultimately evaluate the role of cell-wall melanization in stress survival. Differential expression was observed for proteins involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolic processes, transport, and ribosome biogenesis and translation via ribosomal translational machinery. However, no evidence of significant activation of stress components or starvation response was detected, except for the scytalone dehydratase, enzyme involved in the synthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene (DNH) melanin, which was found to be upregulated in the secretome of the wild type and downregulated in the mutant. Differences in protein modulation were observed between K. chersonesos Wt and Mut, with several proteins being downregulated under LSSMG in the Mut when compared to the Wt. Lastly, no major morphological alterations were observed following exposure to LSSMG. Similarly, the strains’ survivability was not negatively affected. This study is the first to characterize the response to simulated microgravity in black fungi, which might have implications on future astrobiological missions.

Investigation of Spaceflight Induced Changes to Astronaut Microbiomes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11988970/,"Space flight has many adverse effects on the physiological functions of astronauts. Certain similarities have been observed in some physiological processes of rodents and astronauts in space, although there are also differences. These similarities make rodents helpful models for initial investigations into space-induced physiological changes. This study uses a 3D-Clinostat to simulate microgravity and explores the role of microgravity in space flight-induced liver and brain abnormalities by comparing changes in the gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and the function and physiological biochemistry of liver and brain tissues between the simulated microgravity (SMG) group mice and the wild type (WT) group mice. The study, based on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, 16S sequencing technology, and non-targeted metabolomics analysis, shows that the gut tissue morphology of the SMG group mice is abnormal, and the structure of the gut microbiota and the serum metabolite profile are imbalanced. Furthermore, using PICRUST 2 technology, we have predicted the functions of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites, and the results indicate that the liver metabolism and functions (including lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism, etc.) of the SMG group mice are disrupted, and the brain tissue metabolism and functions (including neurotransmitters and hormone secretion, etc.) are abnormal, suggesting a close relationship between microgravity and liver metabolic dysfunction and brain dysfunction. Additionally, the high similarity in the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolite profile between the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) group mice and the SMG group mice, and the physiological and biochemical differences in liver and brain tissues compared to the WT group mice, suggest that microgravity induces imbalances in the gut microbiota, which in turn triggers abnormalities in liver and brain metabolism and function. Finally, through MetaMapp analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, we found that valeric acid, a metabolite of gut microbiota, is more likely to be the key metabolite that relates to microgravity-induced gut microbiota abnormalities, disorders of amino acid and lipid metabolism, and further induced metabolic or functional disorders in the liver and brain. This study has significant practical application value for deepening the understanding of the adaptability of living organisms in the space environment.

A complete metagenome-assembled genome was generated from the shotgun reads metagenome, and its comparison with the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of the ISS S. sanguinis isolates revealed that they were highly similar. In addition to the phylogeny, the WGS of these Sphingomonas strains were compared with the WGS of the type strains to elucidate genes that can potentially aid in plant growth promotion. Furthermore, the WGS comparison of these strains with the well-characterized Sphingomonas sp. LK11, an arid desert strain, identified several genes responsible for the production of phytohormones and for stress tolerance. Production of one of the phytohormones, indole-3-acetic acid, was further confirmed in the ISS strains using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake, metabolism, and solubilization in soil were conserved across all the S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains tested. Furthermore, genes thought to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be present in these space-related S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains. Characterizing these biotechnologically important microorganisms found on the ISS and harnessing their key features will aid in the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future. IMPORTANCE Sphingomonas is ubiquitous in nature, including the anthropogenically contaminated extreme environments. Members of the Sphingomonas genus have been identified as potential candidates for space biomining beyond earth. This study describes the isolation and identification of Sphingomonas members from the ISS, which are capable of producing the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Microbial production of phytohormones will help future in situ studies, grow plants beyond low earth orbit, and establish self-sustainable life support systems. Beyond phytohormone production, stable genomic elements of abiotic stress resistance, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance were identified, rendering the ISS Sphingomonas isolate a strong candidate for biotechnology-related applications.

"Genomic Characterization of the Titan-like Cell Producing Naganishia tulchinskyi, the First Novel Eukaryote Isolated from the International Space Station",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8875396/,"Multiple strains of a novel yeast belonging to genus Naganishia were isolated from environmental surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These strains exhibited a phenotype similar to Titan cell (~10 µm diameter) morphology when grown under a combination of simulated microgravity and 5% CO 2 conditions. Confocal, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological differences between the microgravity-grown cells and the standard Earth gravity-grown cells, including larger cells and thicker cell walls, altered intracellular morphology, modifications to extracellular fimbriae, budding, and the shedding of bud scars. Phylogenetic analyses via multi-locus sequence typing indicated that these ISS strains represented a single species in the genus Naganishia and were clustered with Naganishia diffluens . The name Naganishia tulchinskyi is proposed to accommodate these strains, with IF6SW-B1 T as the holotype. The gene ontologies were assigned to the cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, suggesting a variety of phenotypes that are well suited to respond to microgravity and radiation. Genomic analyses also indicated that the extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were among the highest cellular component results, thus implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the highest molecular function matches included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity.

Metabolic modeling of the International Space Station microbiome reveals key microbial interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9258157/,"Background Recent studies have provided insights into the persistence and succession of microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS), notably the dominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae . However, the interactions between the various microbes aboard the ISS and how they shape the microbiome remain to be clearly understood. In this study, we apply a computational approach to predict possible metabolic interactions in the ISS microbiome and shed further light on its organization. Results Through a combination of a systems-based graph-theoretical approach, and a constraint-based community metabolic modeling approach, we demonstrated several key interactions in the ISS microbiome. These complementary approaches provided insights into the metabolic interactions and dependencies present amongst various microbes in a community, highlighting key interactions and keystone species. Our results showed that the presence of K. pneumoniae is beneficial to many other microorganisms it coexists with, notably those from the Pantoea genus. Species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were often found to be the most beneficial for the survival of other microorganisms in the ISS microbiome. However, K. pneumoniae was found to exhibit parasitic and amensalistic interactions with Aspergillus and Penicillium species, respectively. To prove this metabolic prediction, K. pneumoniae and Aspergillus fumigatus were co-cultured under normal and simulated microgravity, where K. pneumoniae cells showed parasitic characteristics to the fungus. The electron micrography revealed that the presence of K. pneumoniae compromised the morphology of fungal conidia and degenerated its biofilm-forming structures. Conclusion Our study underscores the importance of K. pneumoniae in the ISS, and its potential positive and negative interactions with other microbes, including potential pathogens. This integrated modeling approach, combined with experiments, demonstrates the potential for understanding the organization of other such microbiomes, unravelling key organisms and their interdependencies.

"Microbial Burden Estimation of Food Items, Built Environments, and the International Space Station Using Film Media",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9503880/,"The use of film media involves considerably less preparation, waste, and incubator space than conventional agar-media-based assays and has proven in past studies to provide counts of cultivable microbes similar to those of traditional agar media. Film media also have the advantage of allowing sample volumes similar to those used in pour plates and, therefore, are well-suited for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms or space habitats, particularly where the subsequent isolation of colonies is necessary. As the preparation of film media plates relies on water cohesion/adhesion rather than manual spreading, they may have future applications in low- or microgravity settings. In this study, cultivable microbial count performance was compared between agar media and film media in three kinds of samples: food items, surfaces in built environments on Earth (homes), and on the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). Easy Plates (Kikkoman Corporation) and Petrifilm (3M) were compared with traditional agar plating for food and home surfaces, while only Easy Plates were compared with agar for ISS samples. For both food items and built environments on Earth, both types of film media performed comparably to agar media for bacterial counts, with R 2 values of 0.94–0.96. Fungal counts for built-environment samples had a lower correlation between film and agar counts, with R 2 values of 0.72–0.73. Samples from the ISS, which ranged from below detection to 10 3 CFU per 100 cm 2 , had R 2 values of 0.80 for bacterial counts and 0.73 for fungal counts, partially due to multiple samples recording below the detection limit for agar or too numerous to count, and the growth of fungal species on R2A medium. The species compositions of isolates picked from agar vs. film media plates were similar; however, further phylogenetic analysis is needed to confirm the differential microbial diversity composition. Overall, film media such as Easy Plates and Petrifilm are viable alternatives to agar plates for low-biomass built environments as well as for food samples, and the two brands tested in this study performed equally well.

Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter pittii is adapting to and exhibiting potential succession aboard the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9743659/,"Background Monitoring the adaptation of microorganisms to the extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) is crucial to understanding microbial evolution and infection prevention. Acinetobacter pittii is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen, primarily impacting immunocompromised patients, that was recently isolated from two missions aboard the ISS. Results Here, we report how ISS-associated A. pittii ( n = 20 genomes) has formed its own genetically and functionally discrete clade distinct from most Earth-bound isolates ( n = 291 genomes). The antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ISS strains and two related clinical isolates demonstrated that ISS strains acquired more resistance, specifically with regard to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, despite no prediction of increased resistance based on genomic analysis of resistance genes. By investigating 402 longitudinal environmental and host-associated ISS metagenomes, we observed that viable A. pittii is increasing in relative abundance and therefore potentially exhibiting succession, being identified in >2X more metagenomic samples in back-to-back missions. ISS strains additionally contain functions that enable them to survive in harsh environments, including the transcriptional regulator LexA. Via a genome-wide association study, we identified a high level of mutational burden in methionine sulfoxide reductase genes relative to the most closely related Earth strains. Conclusions Overall, these results indicated a step forward in understanding how microorganisms might evolve and alter their antibiotic resistance phenotype in extreme, resource-limited, human-built environments.

Genomic analysis reveals the presence of emerging pathogenic Klebsiella lineages aboard the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10715203/,"Klebsiella species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae , Klebsiella aerogenes , and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae , are opportunistic pathogens that commonly cause infections in humans. Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) is a subgroup of K. pneumoniae, which has gained attention due to its global dissemination, its capacity to cause invasive infections in community settings among immunocompetent individuals, and its escalating antibiotic resistance levels. Our study presents the first comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic analysis including mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of Klebsiella isolates from the International Space Station (ISS). The genomes of K. pneumoniae , K. aerogenes , and K. quasipneumoniae offered insights into their antimicrobial resistance, virulence, thermotolerance, disinfectant resistance, and MGEs. All isolates were part of emerging pathogenic lineages with K. quasipneumoniae ST138 presenting spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, possibly due to its genotypic profile encoding for numerous resistance genes to disinfectants and heavy metals. We also report on the isolation of a yersiniabactin-encoding K. pneumoniae, belonging to the emerging high-risk ST101 clone, aboard the ISS. A potential dissemination of hvKp strains on ISS might pose a risk to the immunocompromised crew members. Moreover, MGEs containing virulent loci could enable horizontal gene transfer to other benign microorganisms on the ISS, possibly enhancing their virulence potential. Additionally, some Klebsiella genomes exhibited genetic divergence from their respective lineages, which we hypothesize results from the unique spaceflight associated environmental pressures. These findings underscore the need to monitor microbial communities in space to comprehend their survival mechanisms and implications for human health. IMPORTANCE The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique, hermetically sealed environment, subject to environmental pressures not encountered on Earth, including microgravity and radiation (cosmic ionising/UV). While bacteria's adaptability during spaceflight remains elusive, recent research suggests that it may be species and even clone-specific. Considering the documented spaceflight-induced suppression of the human immune system, a deper understanding of the genomics of potential human pathogens in space could shed light on species and lineages of medical astromicrobiological significance. In this study, we used hybrid assembly methods and comparative genomics to deliver a comprehensive genomic characterization of 10 Klebsiella isolates retrieved from the ISS. Our analysis unveiled that Klebsiella quasipneumoniae ST138 demonstrates both spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, showing evidence of genomic divergence from its Earth-based ST138 lineage. Moreover, we characterized plasmids from Klebsiella species of ISS origin, which harbored genes for disinfectant resistance and enhanced thermotolerance, suggestin possible adaptive advantages. Furthermore, we identified a mobile genetic element containing a hypervirulence-associated locus belonging to a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate of the “high-risk” ST101 clone. Our work provides insights into the adaptability and persistence of Klebsiella species during spaceflight, highlighting the importance of understanding the dynamics of potential pathogenic bacteria in such environments.

"Phylogenomics, phenotypic, and functional traits of five novel (Earth-derived) bacterial species isolated from the International Space Station and their prevalence in metagenomes",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10628120/,"With the advent of long-term human habitation in space and on the moon, understanding how the built environment microbiome of space habitats differs from Earth habitats, and how microbes survive, proliferate and spread in space conditions, is becoming more important. The microbial tracking mission series has been monitoring the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) for almost a decade. During this mission series, six unique strains of Gram-stain-positive bacteria, including two spore-forming and three non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the environmental surfaces of the ISS. The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed > 99% similarities with previously described bacterial species. To further explore their phylogenetic affiliation, whole genome sequencing was undertaken. For all strains, the gyrB gene exhibited < 93% similarity with closely related species, which proved effective in categorizing these ISS strains as novel species. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values, when compared to any known bacterial species, were < 94% and <50% respectively for all species described here. Traditional biochemical tests, fatty acid profiling, polar lipid, and cell wall composition analyses were performed to generate phenotypic characterization of these ISS strains. A study of the shotgun metagenomic reads from the ISS samples, from which the novel species were isolated, showed that only 0.1% of the total reads mapped to the novel species, supporting the idea that these novel species are rare in the ISS environments. In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis of these ISS-isolated organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense. The main predicted functions of these genes are: conferring resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and enabling invasion and intracellular resistance. After conducting antiSMASH analysis, it was found that there are roughly 16 cluster types across the six strains, including β-lactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters. Based on these multi-faceted taxonomic methods, it was concluded that these six ISS strains represent five novel species, which we propose to name as follows: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10 T (= NRRL B-65660 T = DSM 115933 T ), Leifsonia virtsii F6_8S_P_1A T (= NRRL B-65661 T = DSM 115931 T ), Leifsonia williamsii F6_8S_P_1B T (= NRRL B-65662 T = DSM 115932 T ), Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1C T (= NRRL B-65663 T = DSM 115940 T ), and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2 T (= NRRL B-65664 T = DSM 115943 T ). Identifying and characterizing the genomes and phenotypes of novel microbes found in space habitats, like those explored in this study, is integral for expanding our genomic databases of space-relevant microbes. This approach offers the only reliable method to determine species composition, track microbial dispersion, and anticipate potential threats to human health from monitoring microbes on the surfaces and equipment within space habitats. By unraveling these microbial mysteries, we take a crucial step towards ensuring the safety and success of future space missions.

"Genomic, functional, and metabolic enhancements in multidrug-resistant Enterobacter bugandensis facilitating its persistence and succession in the International Space Station",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10960378/,"Background The International Space Station (ISS) stands as a testament to human achievement in space exploration. Despite its highly controlled environment, characterised by microgravity, increased CO 2 levels, and elevated solar radiation, microorganisms occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing the health and well-being of astronauts on board. One microorganism of particular interest in our study is Enterobacter bugandensis , primarily found in clinical specimens including the human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported to possess pathogenic traits, leading to a plethora of infections. Results Distinct from their Earth counterparts, ISS E. bugandensis strains have exhibited resistance mechanisms that categorise them within the ESKAPE pathogen group, a collection of pathogens recognised for their formidable resistance to antimicrobial treatments. During the 2-year Microbial Tracking 1 mission, 13 strains of multidrug-resistant E. bugandensis were isolated from various locations within the ISS. We have carried out a comprehensive study to understand the genomic intricacies of ISS-derived E. bugandensis in comparison to terrestrial strains, with a keen focus on those associated with clinical infections. We unravel the evolutionary trajectories of pivotal genes, especially those contributing to functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance. A hypothesis central to our study was that the singular nature of the stresses of the space environment, distinct from any on Earth, could be driving these genomic adaptations. Extending our investigation, we meticulously mapped the prevalence and distribution of E. bugandensis across the ISS over time. This temporal analysis provided insights into the persistence, succession, and potential patterns of colonisation of E. bugandensis in space. Furthermore, by leveraging advanced analytical techniques, including metabolic modelling, we delved into the coexisting microbial communities alongside E. bugandensis in the ISS across multiple missions and spatial locations. This exploration revealed intricate microbial interactions, offering a window into the microbial ecosystem dynamics within the ISS. Conclusions Our comprehensive analysis illuminated not only the ways these interactions sculpt microbial diversity but also the factors that might contribute to the potential dominance and succession of E. bugandensis within the ISS environment. The implications of these findings are twofold. Firstly, they shed light on microbial behaviour, adaptation, and evolution in extreme, isolated environments. Secondly, they underscore the need for robust preventive measures, ensuring the health and safety of astronauts by mitigating risks associated with potential pathogenic threats.

Adaptation to space conditions of novel bacterial species isolated from the International Space Station revealed by functional gene annotations and comparative genome analysis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11451251/,"Background The extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions. Results In this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool—deepFRI—we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity. Conclusion Our findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.

Cortical thinning and structural bone changes in non-human primates after single-fraction whole-chest irradiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6036641/,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is associated with an increased risk of vertebral compression fracture ( 1 – 5 ). While bone is typically considered radiation-resistant, fractures frequently occur within the first year of SBRT ( 6 – 11 ). Our purpose was to determine if rapid deterioration of bone occurs in vertebrae post-irradiation (IR). Sixteen male rhesus macaques non-human primates (NHPs) were analyzed after total chest irradiation (IR) to a midplane dose of 10 Gy. Ages at IR varied from 45 – 134 mo. Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken 2 mo prior to IR and 2, 4, 6, and 8 mo post-IR for all animals. Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) were calculated longitudinally for thoracic (T)9, lumbar (L)2, and L4 vertebral bodies; gross morphology and histopathology were assessed per vertebra. Greater mortality (related to pulmonary toxicity) was noted in NHPs < 50 mo at time of IR vs NHPs > 50mo (p = 0.03). Animals older than 50 mo at IR lost Ct.Th in T9 by 2 mo post IR (p = 0.0009), which persisted to 8 mo. In contrast, no loss of Ct.Th was observed in vertebrae out-of-field (L2 and L4). Loss of BMD was observed by 4 mo post-IR for T9, and 6 mo post IR for L2 and L4 (p < 0.01). For NHPs younger than 50 mo at IR, both Ct.Th and BMD decreased in T9, L2, and L4 by 2 mo post-IR (p < 0.05). Regions that exhibited the greatest degree of cortical thinning as determined from CT scans also exhibited increased porosity histologically. Rapid loss of Ct.Th was observed after high dose chest IR in NHPs. Younger age at IR was associated with increased pneumonitis related mortality, as well as greater loss of both BMD and Ct.Th at both in-and out-of-field vertebrae. Older NHPs exhibited rapid loss of BMD and Ct.Th from in-field vertebrae, but only loss of BMD in out of field vertebrae.

Knee and Hip Joint Cartilage Damage from Combined Spaceflight Hazards of Low-Dose Radiation Less than 1 Gy and Prolonged Hinlimb Unloading. Radiat. Res. 191, 497–506 (2019). Reduced weight bearing, and to a lesser extent radiation, during spaceflight have been shown as potential hazards to astronaut joint health. These hazards combined effect to the knee and hip joints are not well defined, particularly with low-dose exposure to radiation. In this study, we examined the individual and combined effects of varying low-dose radiation (≤1 Gy) and reduced weight bearing on the cartilage of the knee and hip joints. C57BL/6J mice (n = 80) were either tail suspended via hindlimb unloading (HLU) or remained full-weight bearing (ground). On day 6, each group was divided and irradiated with 0 Gy (sham), 0.1 Gy, 0.5 Gy or 1.0 Gy (n = 10/group), yielding eight groups: ground-sham; ground-0.1 Gy; ground-0.5 Gy; ground-1.0 Gy; HLU-sham; HLU-0.1 Gy; HLU-0.5 Gy; and HLU-1.0 Gy. On day 30, the hindlimbs, hip cartilage and serum were collected from the mice. Significant differences were identified statistically between treatment groups and the ground-sham control group, but no significant differences were observed between HLU and/or radiation groups. Contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography (micro-CECT) demonstrated decrease in volume and thickness at the weight-bearing femoral-tibial cartilage-cartilage contact point in all treatment groups compared to ground-sham. Lower collagen was observed in all groups compared to ground-sham. Circulating serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP), a biomarker for ongoing cartilage degradation, was increased in all of the irradiated groups compared to ground-sham, regardless of unloading. Mass spectrometry of the cartilage lining the femoral head and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified a decrease in cartilage compositional proteins indicative of osteoarthritis. Our findings demonstrate that both individually and combined, HLU and exposure to spaceflight-relevant radiation doses lead to cartilage degradation of the knee and hip with expression of an arthritic phenotype. Moreover, early administration of low-dose irradiation (0.1, 0.5 or 1.0 Gy) causes an active catabolic response in cartilage 24 days postirradiation.

The individual and combined effects of spaceflight radiation and microgravity on biologic systems and functional outcomes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8274610/,"Both microgravity and radiation exposure in the spaceflight environment have been identified as hazards to astronaut health and performance. Substantial study has been focused on understanding the biology and risks associated with prolonged exposure to microgravity, and the hazards presented by radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPEs) outside of low earth orbit (LEO). To date, the majority of the ground-based analogues (e.g., rodent or cell culture studies) that investigate the biology of and risks associated with spaceflight hazards will focus on an individual hazard in isolation. However, astronauts will face these challenges simultaneously Combined hazard studies are necessary for understanding the risks astronauts face as they travel outside of LEO, and are also critical for countermeasure development. The focus of this review is to describe biologic and functional outcomes from ground-based analogue models for microgravity and radiation, specifically highlighting the combined effects of radiation and reduced weight-bearing from rodent ground-based tail suspension via hind limb unloading (HLU) and partial weight-bearing (PWB) models, although in vitro and spaceflight results are discussed as appropriate.

Spaceflight and hind limb unloading induces an arthritic phenotype in knee articular cartilage and menisci of rodents,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8131644/,"Reduced knee weight-bearing from prescription or sedentary lifestyles are associated with cartilage degradation; effects on the meniscus are unclear. Rodents exposed to spaceflight or hind limb unloading (HLU) represent unique opportunities to evaluate this question. This study evaluated arthritic changes in the medial knee compartment that bears the highest loads across the knee after actual and simulated spaceflight, and recovery with subsequent full weight-bearing. Cartilage and meniscal degradation in mice were measured via microCT, histology, and proteomics and/or biochemically after: (1) ~ 35 days on the International Space Station (ISS); (2) 13-days aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis; or (3) 30 days of HLU, followed by a 49-day weight-bearing readaptation with/without exercise. Cartilage degradation post-ISS and HLU occurred at similar spatial locations, the tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact point, with meniscal volume decline. Cartilage and meniscal glycosaminoglycan content were decreased in unloaded mice, with elevated catabolic enzymes (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases), and elevated oxidative stress and catabolic molecular pathway responses in menisci. After the 13-day Shuttle flight, meniscal degradation was observed. During readaptation, recovery of cartilage volume and thickness occurred with exercise.

Prolonged exposure to particulate chromate inhibits RAD51 nuclear import mediator proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5568470/,"Particulate hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is a human lung carcinogen and a human health concern. The induction of structural chromosome instability is considered to be a driving mechanism of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. Homologous recombination repair protects against Cr(VI)-induced chromosome damage, due to its highly accurate repair of Cr(VI)-induced DNA double strand breaks. However, recent studies demonstrate Cr(VI) inhibits homologous recombination repair through the misregulation of RAD51. RAD51 is an essential protein in HR repair that facilitates the search for a homologous sequence. Recent studies show prolonged Cr(VI) exposure prevents proper RAD51 subcellular localization, causing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Since nuclear import of RAD51 is crucial to its function, this study investigated the effect of Cr(VI) on the RAD51 nuclear import mediators, RAD51C and BRCA2. We show acute (24 h) Cr(VI) exposure induces the proper localization of RAD51C and BRCA2. In contrast, prolonged (120 h) exposure increased the cytoplasmic localization of both proteins, although RAD51C localization was more severely impaired. These results correlate temporally with the previously reported Cr(VI)-induced RAD51 cytoplasmic accumulation. In addition, we found Cr(VI) does not inhibit interaction between RAD51 and its nuclear import mediators. Altogether, our results suggest prolonged Cr(VI) exposure inhibits the nuclear import of RAD51C, and to a lesser extent, BRCA2, which results in the cytoplasmic accumulation of RAD51. Cr(VI)-induced inhibition of nuclear import may play a key role in its carcinogenic mechanism since the nuclear import of many tumor suppressor proteins and DNA repair proteins is crucial to their function.

"Transcriptomics, NF-Œ∫B Pathway, and Their Potential Spaceflight-Related Health Consequences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5485990/,"In space, living organisms are exposed to multiple stress factors including microgravity and space radiation. For humans, these harmful environmental factors have been known to cause negative health impacts such as bone loss and immune dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms by which spaceflight impacts human health at the molecular level is critical not only for accurately assessing the risks associated with spaceflight, but also for developing effective countermeasures. Over the years, a number of studies have been conducted under real or simulated space conditions. RNA and protein levels in cellular and animal models have been targeted in order to identify pathways affected by spaceflight. Of the many pathways responsive to the space environment, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) network appears to commonly be affected across many different cell types under the true or simulated spaceflight conditions. NF-κB is of particular interest, as it is associated with many of the spaceflight-related health consequences. This review intends to summarize the transcriptomics studies that identified NF-κB as a responsive pathway to ground-based simulated microgravity or the true spaceflight condition. These studies were carried out using either human cell or animal models. In addition, the review summarizes the studies that focused specifically on NF-κB pathway in specific cell types or organ tissues as related to the known spaceflight-related health risks including immune dysfunction, bone loss, muscle atrophy, central nerve system (CNS) dysfunction, and risks associated with space radiation. Whether the NF-κB pathway is activated or inhibited in space is dependent on the cell type, but the potential health impact appeared to be always negative. It is argued that more studies on NF-κB should be conducted to fully understand this particular pathway for the benefit of crew health in space.

Interplay of space radiation and microgravity in DNA damage and DNA damage response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5460239/,"In space, multiple unique environmental factors, particularly microgravity and space radiation, pose constant threat to the DNA integrity of living organisms. Specifically, space radiation can cause damage to DNA directly, through the interaction of charged particles with the DNA molecules themselves, or indirectly through the production of free radicals. Although organisms have evolved strategies on Earth to confront such damage, space environmental conditions, especially microgravity, can impact DNA repair resulting in accumulation of severe DNA lesions. Ultimately these lesions, namely double strand breaks, chromosome aberrations, micronucleus formation, or mutations, can increase the risk for adverse health effects, such as cancer. How spaceflight factors affect DNA damage and the DNA damage response has been investigated since the early days of the human space program. Over the years, these experiments have been conducted either in space or using ground-based analogs. This review summarizes the evidence for DNA damage induction by space radiation and/or microgravity as well as spaceflight-related impacts on the DNA damage response. The review also discusses the conflicting results from studies aimed at addressing the question of potential synergies between microgravity and radiation with regard to DNA damage and cellular repair processes.

"Synergistic Effects of Weightlessness, Isoproterenol, and Radiation on DNA Damage Response and Cytokine Production in Immune Cells",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6275019/,"The implementation of rotating-wall vessels (RWVs) for studying the effect of lack of gravity has attracted attention, especially in the fields of stem cells, tissue regeneration, and cancer research. Immune cells incubated in RWVs exhibit several features of immunosuppression including impaired leukocyte proliferation, cytokine responses, and antibody production. Interestingly, stress hormones influence cellular immune pathways affected by microgravity, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and T cell activation. These pathways are crucial defense mechanisms that protect the cell from toxins, pathogens, and radiation. Despite the importance of the adrenergic receptor in regulating the immune system, the effect of microgravity on the adrenergic system has been poorly studied. Thus, we elected to investigate the synergistic effects of isoproterenol (a sympathomimetic drug), radiation, and microgravity in nonstimulated immune cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with the sympathomimetic drug isoproterenol, exposed to 0.8 or 2 Gy γ-radiation, and incubated in RWVs. Mixed model regression analyses showed significant synergistic effects on the expression of the β2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2). Radiation alone increased ADRB2 expression, and cells incubated in microgravity had more DNA strand breaks than cells incubated in normal gravity. We observed radiation-induced cytokine production only in microgravity. Prior treatment with isoproterenol clearly prevents most of the microgravity-mediated effects. RWVs may be a useful tool to provide insight into novel regulatory pathways, providing benefit not only to astronauts but also to patients suffering from immune disorders or undergoing radiotherapy.

Transcriptome and proteome responses in RNAlater preserved tissue of Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5397022/,"Tissue preservation is a minimal requirement for the success of plant RNA and protein expression studies. The standard of snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen is not always practical or possible.

Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RNAlater in preserving both RNA and proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana tissues for use in RNAseq and LC-MS/MS analysis of proteins. While successful in preserving plant material, a transcriptomic and proteomic response is evident. Specifically, 5770 gene transcripts, 84 soluble proteins, and 120 membrane-bound proteins were found to be differentially expressed at a log-fold change of ±1 (P ≤ 0.05). This response is mirrored in the abundance of post-translational modifications, with 23 of the 108 (21.3%) phosphorylated proteins showing altered abundance at a log-fold change of ±1 (P ≤ 0.05).

Spaceflight induces novel regulatory responses in Arabidopsis seedling as revealed by combined proteomic and transcriptomic analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7251690/,"Background Understanding of gravity sensing and response is critical to long-term human habitation in space and can provide new advantages for terrestrial agriculture. To this end, the altered gene expression profile induced by microgravity has been repeatedly queried by microarray and RNA-seq experiments to understand gravitropism. However, the quantification of altered protein abundance in space has been minimally investigated. Results Proteomic (iTRAQ-labelled LC-MS/MS) and transcriptomic (RNA-seq) analyses simultaneously quantified protein and transcript differential expression of three-day old, etiolated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown aboard the International Space Station along with their ground control counterparts. Protein extracts were fractionated to isolate soluble and membrane proteins and analyzed to detect differentially phosphorylated peptides. In total, 968 RNAs, 107 soluble proteins, and 103 membrane proteins were identified as differentially expressed. In addition, the proteomic analyses identified 16 differential phosphorylation events. Proteomic data delivered novel insights and simultaneously provided new context to previously made observations of gene expression in microgravity. There is a sweeping shift in post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene regulation including RNA-decapping protein DCP5, the splicing factors GRP7 and GRP8, and AGO4,. These data also indicate AHA2 and FERONIA as well as CESA1 and SHOU4 as central to the cell wall adaptations seen in spaceflight. Patterns of tubulin-α 1, 3,4 and 6 phosphorylation further reveal an interaction of microtubule and redox homeostasis that mirrors osmotic response signaling elements. The absence of gravity also results in a seemingly wasteful dysregulation of plastid gene transcription. Conclusions The datasets gathered from Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to microgravity revealed marked impacts on post-transcriptional regulation, cell wall synthesis, redox/microtubule dynamics, and plastid gene transcription. The impact of post-transcriptional regulatory alterations represents an unstudied element of the plant microgravity response with the potential to significantly impact plant growth efficiency and beyond. What’s more, addressing the effects of microgravity on AHA2, CESA1, and alpha tubulins has the potential to enhance cytoskeletal organization and cell wall composition, thereby enhancing biomass production and growth in microgravity. Finally, understanding and manipulating the dysregulation of plastid gene transcription has further potential to address the goal of enhancing plant growth in the stressful conditions of microgravity.

Mitigation and use of biofilms in space for the benefit of human space exploration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10284894/,"With the construction of the International Space Station, humans have been continuously living and working in space for 22 years. Microbial studies in space and other extreme environments on Earth have shown the ability for bacteria and fungi to adapt and change compared to “normal” conditions. Some of these changes, like biofilm formation, can impact astronaut health and spacecraft integrity in a negative way, while others, such as a propensity for plastic degradation, can promote self-sufficiency and sustainability in space. With the next era of space exploration upon us, which will see crewed missions to the Moon and Mars in the next 10 years, incorporating microbiology research into planning, decision-making, and mission design will be paramount to ensuring success of these long-duration missions. These can include astronaut microbiome studies to protect against infections, immune system dysfunction and bone deterioration, or biological in situ resource utilization (bISRU) studies that incorporate microbes to act as radiation shields, create electricity and establish robust plant habitats for fresh food and recycling of waste. In this review, information will be presented on the beneficial use of microbes in bioregenerative life support systems, their applicability to bISRU, and their capability to be genetically engineered for biotechnological space applications. In addition, we discuss the negative effect microbes and microbial communities may have on long-duration space travel and provide mitigation strategies to reduce their impact.

However, space voyage is very challenging and dangerous, and astronauts are under constant space radiation and microgravity. It has been shown that astronauts are at a high risk of developing a broad range of diseases/disorders. Thus, it is critical to develop a rapid and effective assay to monitor astronauts’ health in space. In this study, gene expression and correlation patterns were analyzed for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708. We identified 218 differentially expressed genes between In-flight and Pre-flight and noticed that space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations across the entire genome, as well as individual signaling pathways. Furthermore, we systematically developed a shortlist of 32 genes that could be used to monitor astronauts’ health during space travel. Further studies, including microgravity experiments, are warranted to optimize and validate the proposed assay.

Overexpression of CupB5 activates alginate overproduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by a novel AlgW-dependent mechanism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4116675/,"Summary In P. aeruginosa , alginate overproduction, also known as mucoidy, is negatively regulated by the transmembrane protein MucA, which sequesters the alternative sigma factor AlgU. MucA is degraded via a proteolysis pathway that frees AlgU from sequestration, activating alginate biosynthesis. Initiation of this pathway normally requires two signals: peptide sequences in unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) activate the AlgW protease, and unassembled lipopolysaccharides bind periplasmic MucB, releasing MucA and facilitating its proteolysis by activated AlgW. To search for novel alginate regulators, we screened a transposon library in the non-mucoid reference strain PAO1, and identified a mutant that confers mucoidy through overexpression of a protein encoded by the c haperone- u sher p athway gene cupB5 . CupB5-dependent mucoidy occurs through the AlgU pathway and can be reversed by overexpression of MucA or MucB. In the presence of activating OMP peptides, peptides corresponding to a region of CupB5 needed for mucoidy further stimulated AlgW cleavage of MucA in vitro . Moreover, the CupB5 peptide allowed OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA in the presence of the MucB inhibitor. These results support a novel mechanism for conversion to mucoidy in which the proteolytic activity of AlgW and its ability to compete with MucB for MucA is mediated by independent peptide signals.

Burn injury-associated MHCII(+) immune cell accumulation around lymphatic vessels of the mesentery and increased lymphatic endothelial permeability are blocked by doxycycline treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5810432/,"It is theorized that toxic agents are transported from the hyperpermeable gut of burn victims through the lymph, to the systemic circulation, causing global injury. We believe that immune cells respond to leakage of “toxic lymph” following trauma causing the attraction of these cells to the perilymphatic space. To test this, we utilized a model of burn on rats to examine changes in a single immune cell population associated with mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction. We examined the ability of serum from these animals to increase permeability in lymphatic endothelial monolayers and disrupt cellular junctions. We also treated burn animals with doxycycline, an inhibitor of microvascular permeability, and observed the effects on immune cell populations, morphometry, and lymphatic endothelial permeability. Burn injury increased the number of MHCII + immune cells along the vessel (>50%). The size and shape of these cells also changed significantly following burn injury. Serum from burn animals increased lymphatic endothelial permeability (∼1.5-fold) and induced breaks in VE-cadherin staining. Doxycycline treatment blocked the accumulation of immune cells along the vessel, whereas serum from doxycycline-treated animals failed to increase lymphatic endothelial permeability. The size of cells along the vessel in doxycycline-treated burn animals was not affected, suggesting that the cells already present on the lymphatic vessels still respond to substances in the lymph. These findings suggest that factors produced during burn can induce lymphatic endothelial barrier disruption and lymph produced during traumatic injury can influence the attraction and morphology of immune cell populations along the vessel.

In situ resource utilisation: The potential for space biomining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8739323/,"As we aim to expand human presence in space, we need to find viable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources. Space biomining of the Moon, Mars and asteroids has been indicated as one of the promising approaches to achieve in-situ resource utilization by the main space agencies. Structural and expensive metals, essential mineral nutrients, water, oxygen and volatiles could be potentially extracted from extraterrestrial regolith and rocks using microbial-based biotechnologies. The use of bioleaching microorganisms could also be applied to space bioremediation, recycling of waste and to reinforce regenerative life support systems. However, the science around space biomining is still young. Relevant differences between terrestrial and extraterrestrial conditions exist, including the rock types and ores available for mining, and a direct application of established terrestrial biomining techniques may not be a possibility. It is, therefore, necessary to invest in terrestrial and space-based research of specific methods for space applications to learn the effects of space conditions on biomining and bioremediation, expand our knowledge on organotrophic and community-based bioleaching mechanisms, as well as on anaerobic biomining, and investigate the use of synthetic biology to overcome limitations posed by the space environments.

An Earth-based approach was designed and implemented using inclined clinostats and an in-house-developed code to determine the optimal clinorotation angular speed for bacterial liquid cultures of 5 RPM. With this setup, growth dynamics, phenotypic changes, and sensitivity to antibiotics (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of two different classes of antibiotics) for three Escherichia coli strains (including uropathogenic) were examined under simulated micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities. The results included increased growth under simulated micro- and lunar gravities for some strains, and higher concentrations of antibiotics needed under simulated lunar gravity with respect to simulated micro- and Martian gravities. Clinostat-produced results can be considered suggestive but not determinative of what might be expected in altered gravity, as there is still a need to systematically verify these simulation devices’ ability to accurately replicate phenomena observed in space.

Stainless Steel 316 (SS316) and passivated SS316 were tested for their relevance as spaceflight hardware components, while a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS) was tested as potential biofilm control strategy. The morphology and gene expression of biofilms were characterized. Biofilms in microgravity are less robust than on Earth. LIS strongly inhibits biofilm formation compared to SS. Furthermore, this effect is even greater in spaceflight than on Earth, making LIS a promising option for spacecraft use.

Microalgae are highly efficient at converting light, water, and carbon dioxide into biomass, particularly under limiting, artificial light conditions that are a necessity in space photosynthetic production. Although there is great promise in developing algae for chemical or food production in space, most spaceflight algae growth studies have been conducted on solid agar-media to avoid handling liquids in microgravity. Here we report that breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support robust growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the Veggie plant growth chamber, which is used on the International Space Station (ISS) to grow terrestrial plants. Live cultures can be stored for at least 1 month in the bags at room temperature. The gene set required for growth in these photobioreactors was tested using a competitive growth assay with mutations induced by short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC) mutagenesis in either wild-type (CC-5082) or cw15 mutant (CC-1883) strains at the start of the assay. Genome sequencing identified UVC-induced mutations, which were enriched for transversions and non-synonymous mutations relative to natural variants among laboratory strains. Genes with mutations indicating positive selection were enriched for information processing genes related to DNA repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases, and ABC transporters.

Response of Arabidopsis thaliana and Mizuna mustard seeds to simulated space radiation exposures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8879990/,"One of the major concerns for long-term exploration missions beyond the Earth’s magnetosphere is consequences from exposures to solar particle event (SPE) protons and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). For long-term crewed Lunar and Mars explorations, the production of fresh food in space will provide both nutritional supplements and psychological benefits to the astronauts. However, the effects of space radiation on plants and plant propagules have not been sufficiently investigated and characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effect of two different compositions of charged particles-simulated GCR, and simulated SPE protons on dry and hydrated seeds of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the crop plant Mizuna mustard [ Brassica rapa var. japonica ]. Exposures to charged particles, simulated GCRs (up to 80 cGy) or SPEs (up to 200 cGy), were performed either acutely or at a low dose rate using the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). Control and irradiated seeds were planted in a solid phytogel and grown in a controlled environment. Five to seven days after planting, morphological parameters were measured to evaluate radiation-induced damage in the seedlings. After exposure to single types of charged particles, as well as to simulated GCR, the hydrated Arabidopsis seeds showed dose- and quality-dependent responses, with heavier ions causing more severe defects. Seeds exposed to simulated GCR (dry seeds) and SPE (hydrated seeds) had significant, although much less damage than seeds exposed to heavier and higher linear energy transfer (LET) particles.

37-day microgravity exposure in 16-week female C57BL/6J mice is associated with bone loss specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11940681/,"Exposure to weightlessness in microgravity and elevated space radiation are associated with rapid bone loss in mammals, but questions remain about their mechanisms of action and relative importance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bone loss during spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit is primarily associated with site-specific microgravity unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton. Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA Rodent Research-1 experiment show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative effects in the spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests that space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. Remarkably, spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. This suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary ossification during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks. Furthermore, mice housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat during 1 g ground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone mass declines. These findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater topological enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity.",exposure weightlessness microgravity elevated space radiation associated rapid bone loss mammals questions remain mechanisms action relative importance study tested hypothesis bone loss spaceflight low earth orbit primarily associated sitespecific microgravity unloading weightbearing sites skeleton microcomputed tomography histological analyses bones mice space flown iss days nasa rodent research experiment show significant sitespecific cancellous cortical bone loss occurring femur vertebrae lack bone degenerative effects spine combination sameanimal paired losses femur suggests space radiation levels low earth orbit systemic stresses likely significantly contribute observed bone loss remarkably spaceflight also associated accelerated progression femoral head endochondral ossification suggests microgravity environment promotes premature progression secondary ossification late stages skeletal maturation weeks furthermore mice housed nasa iss rodent habitat ground controls maintained gained bone relative mice housed standard vivarium cages showed significant bone mass declines findings suggest housing rodent habitat greater topological enrichment wiremesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading weightbearing bones maintenance bone mass summary results indicate female mice approaching skeletal maturity mechanical unloading weightbearing sites major cause bone loss microgravity sites loaded predominantly muscle activity spine appear unaffected additionally identified earlyonset femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect may lead premature long bone growth arrest microgravity

Mice were immunized with tetanus toxoid combined with the adjuvant CpG (TT + CpG) and the effects of vaccination in space were studied using transcriptomics. Analysis of the mouse heart transcriptome was performed on flight control and flight-immunized mice. The results show that immunization aboard the ISS stimulates heightened inflammation in the heart via induction of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway to promote the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-6.

Analyzing the relationship between gene expression and phenotype in space-flown mice using a causal inference machine learning ensemble.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11748630/,"Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on human and rodent health. For example, liver dysfunction is a common phenotype observed in space-flown rodents, and this dysfunction is partially reflected in transcriptomic changes. Studies linking transcriptomics with liver dysfunction rely on tools which exploit correlation, but these tools make no attempt to disambiguate true correlations from spurious ones. In this work, we use a machine learning ensemble of causal inference methods called the Causal Research and Inference Search Platform (CRISP) which was developed to predict causal features of a binary response variable from high-dimensional input. We used CRISP to identify genes robustly correlated with a lipid density phenotype using transcriptomic and histological data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). Our approach identified genes and molecular targets not predicted by previous traditional differential gene expression analyses.

Sex-specific cardiovascular adaptations to simulated microgravity in Sprague-Dawley rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11659408/,"Men and women have different cardiovascular responses to spaceflight; however, few studies have focused on direct comparisons between sexes. We investigated the mechanisms of aortic stiffening in socially and sexually mature 20-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 14 days. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was greater in the aortic arch of females after HLU versus control females ( n = 6–8). HLU had no effect on aortic PWV in males ( n = 5–6). Aortic α smooth muscle actin, myosin, collagen, elastin, and collagen-to-elastin ratio were not different in rats of either sex following HLU. The levels of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) were lower in the aorta of SD females exposed to HLU compared with female controls but were not altered in males. HLU females also had lower aortic PPARγ, increased oxidative stress markers, and diastolic dysfunction compared with control females. GPER agonist G1 prevented the increase in PWV and 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine without altering PPARγ or p47phox in HLU females ( n = 4 in each group) suggesting that lower GPER may contribute to arterial stiffening in the setting of simulated microgravity.

Artificial gravity attenuates the transcriptomic response to spaceflight in the optic nerve and retina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11593819/,"The development of eye pathology is a serious concern for astronauts who spend time in deep space. Microgravity is a major component of the spaceflight environment which could have adverse effects on ocular health. The use of centrifugation to exert forces that partially or fully mimic Earth-level gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to microgravity (0 G) or artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G, and then performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. We also find that adding artificial gravity on board the ISS attenuates the transcriptomic response to microgravity in a dose-dependent manner. Such attenuation may effectively protect from and mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue.

Multi-omics analysis of multiple missions to space reveal a theme of lipid dysregulation in mouse liver,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6915713/,"Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) & BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of strain or exposure duration. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across all conditions including Glucagon (GCG) and Insulin (INS). Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis showed that a number of lipid related proteins were changed in the livers during spaceflight. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of lipotoxic pathways are the result of space stressors alone and this activation occurs in various genetic backgrounds during spaceflight exposures of weeks to months. If similar responses occur in humans, a prolonged change of these pathways may result in the development of liver disease and should be investigated further.",spaceflight several detrimental effects physiology astronauts many recapitulated rodent models mouse studies performed space shuttle showed disruption lipid metabolism liver however given animals sacrificed onorbit instead returned live earth unclear disruptions solely induced space stressors microgravity space radiation part explained stress return earth work analyzed three liver datasets two different strains mice cbl jackson balbc taconic flown aboard international space station iss notably animals sacrificed onorbit exposed varying spaceflight durations days days shuttle mice oil red oro staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation spaceflown mice compared ground controls regardless strain exposure duration similarly transcriptomic analysis rnasequencing revealed several pathways affected strains related increased lipid metabolism fatty acid metabolism lipid fatty acid processing lipid catabolic processing lipid localization addition key upstream regulators predicted commonly regulated across conditions including glucagon gcg insulin ins moreover quantitative proteomic analysis showed number lipid related proteins changed livers spaceflight taken together data indicate activation lipotoxic pathways result space stressors alone activation occurs various genetic backgrounds spaceflight exposures weeks months similar responses occur humans prolonged change pathways may result development liver disease investigated
ERULUS is a plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinase that specifies root hair growth by maintaining tip-focused cytoplasmic calcium oscillations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6048781/,"Root hairs are single-cell extensions crucial for nutrient and water uptake, with their tip-focused growth regulated by various molecular components, including receptor-like kinases.

Here, we reassess ERU's function and subcellular localization, challenging the prior model. We isolated a novel recessive *eru-3* mutant, which displayed characteristic short and irregularly shaped root hairs. Expression of a functional UBQ10:ERU-GFP fusion restored wild-type root hair lengths in *eru-3* mutants, confirming its activity.

Evidence for extensive horizontal gene transfer from the draft genome of a tardigrade,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4702960/,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), or the transfer of genes between species, has been recognized recently as more pervasive than previously suspected. Here, we report evidence for an unprecedented degree of HGT into an animal genome, based on a draft genome of a tardigrade, Hypsibius dujardini. Tardigrades are microscopic eight-legged animals that are famous for their ability to survive extreme conditions. Genome sequencing, direct confirmation of physical linkage, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that a large fraction of the H. dujardini genome is derived from diverse bacteria as well as plants, fungi, and Archaea. We estimate that approximately one-sixth of tardigrade genes entered by HGT, nearly double the fraction found in the most extreme cases of HGT into animals known to date. Foreign genes have supplemented, expanded, and even replaced some metazoan gene families within the tardigrade genome. Our results demonstrate that an unexpectedly large fraction of an animal genome can be derived from foreign sources.

Three distinct metrics were applied to these assemblies: the HGT index, identification of genes aligning exclusively to prokaryotic sequences, and classification of ""class C"" genes. Results consistently demonstrated a substantial proportion of foreign genes, with 3.8–7.1% identified by the HGT index, 164–384 genes aligning solely to prokaryotes, and 2.5–4.6% classified as ""class C.""

The Evolution of Temperature and Desiccation-Related Protein Families in Tardigrada Reveals a Complex Acquisition of Extremotolerance,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11831363/,"Tardigrada is an ecdysozoan lineage famed for its resilience. Tardigrades can tolerate high doses of radiation, low-oxygen environments, desiccation, and both high and low temperatures under a dormant state called “anhydrobiosis”, which is a reversible halt of metabolism upon almost complete desiccation. A large amount of research has focused on the genetic pathways related to these capabilities, and a number of genes have been identified and linked to the extremotolerant response of tardigrades. However, the history of these genes is unclear, and the origins and history of extremotolerant genes within Tardigrada remain a mystery. Here, we generate the first phylogenies of six separate protein families linked with desiccation and radiation tolerance in Tardigrada: cytosolic abundant heat-soluble protein, mitochondrial abundant heat-soluble protein, secretory abundant heat-soluble protein, meiotic recombination 11 homolog, and the newly discovered Echiniscus testudo abundant heat-soluble proteins (alpha and beta). The high number of independent gene duplications found amongst the six gene families studied suggests that tardigrades have a complex history with numerous independent adaptations to cope with aridity within the limnoterrestrial environment. Our results suggest that tardigrades likely transitioned from a marine environment to a limnoterrestrial environment only twice, once in stem Eutardigrada and once in Heterotardigrada, which explains the unique adaptations to anhydrobiosis present in both classes.",tardigrada ecdysozoan lineage famed resilience tardigrades tolerate high doses radiation lowoxygen environments desiccation high low temperatures dormant state called anhydrobiosis reversible halt metabolism upon almost complete desiccation large amount research focused genetic pathways related capabilities number genes identified linked extremotolerant response tardigrades however history genes unclear origins history extremotolerant genes within tardigrada remain mystery generate first phylogenies six separate protein families linked desiccation radiation tolerance tardigrada cytosolic abundant heatsoluble protein mitochondrial abundant heatsoluble protein secretory abundant heatsoluble protein meiotic recombination homolog newly discovered echiniscus testudo abundant heatsoluble proteins alpha beta high number independent gene duplications found amongst six gene families studied suggests tardigrades complex history numerous independent adaptations cope aridity within limnoterrestrial environment results suggest tardigrades likely transitioned marine environment limnoterrestrial environment twice stem eutardigrada heterotardigrada explains unique adaptations anhydrobiosis present classes

"High atomic weight, high-energy radiation (HZE) induces transcriptional responses shared with conventional stresses in addition to a core ""DSB"" response specific to clastogenic treatments",https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4117989/,"Plants exhibit a robust transcriptional response to gamma radiation which includes the induction of transcripts required for homologous recombination and the suppression of transcripts that promote cell cycle progression. Various DNA damaging agents induce different spectra of DNA damage as well as “collateral” damage to other cellular components and therefore are not expected to provoke identical responses by the cell. Here we study the effects of two different types of ionizing radiation (IR) treatment, HZE (1 GeV Fe26+ high mass, high charge, and high energy relativistic particles) and gamma photons, on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Both types of IR induce small clusters of radicals that can result in the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs), but HZE also produces linear arrays of extremely clustered damage. We performed these experiments across a range of time points (1.5–24 h after irradiation) in both wild-type plants and in mutants defective in the DSB-sensing protein kinase ATM. The two types of IR exhibit a shared double strand break-repair-related damage response, although they differ slightly in the timing, degree, and ATM-dependence of the response. The ATM-dependent, DNA metabolism-related transcripts of the “DSB response” were also induced by other DNA damaging agents, but were not induced by conventional stresses. Both Gamma and HZE irradiation induced, at 24 h post-irradiation, ATM-dependent transcripts associated with a variety of conventional stresses; these were overrepresented for pathogen response, rather than DNA metabolism. In contrast, only HZE-irradiated plants, at 1.5 h after irradiation, exhibited an additional and very extensive transcriptional response, shared with plants experiencing “extended night.” This response was not apparent in gamma-irradiated plants.",plants exhibit robust transcriptional response gamma radiation includes induction transcripts required homologous recombination suppression transcripts promote cell cycle progression various dna damaging agents induce different spectra dna damage well collateral damage cellular components therefore expected provoke identical responses cell study effects two different types ionizing radiation treatment hze gev high mass high charge high energy relativistic particles gamma photons transcriptome arabidopsis thaliana seedlings types induce small clusters radicals result formation double strand breaks dsbs hze also produces linear arrays extremely clustered damage performed experiments across range time points irradiation wildtype plants mutants defective dsbsensing protein kinase atm two types exhibit shared double strand breakrepairrelated damage response although differ slightly timing degree atmdependence response atmdependent dna metabolismrelated transcripts dsb response also induced dna damaging agents induced conventional stresses gamma hze irradiation induced postirradiation atmdependent transcripts associated variety conventional stresses overrepresented pathogen response rather dna metabolism contrast hzeirradiated plants irradiation exhibited additional extensive transcriptional response shared plants experiencing extended night response apparent gammairradiated plants

Delayed Maturation of Oligodendrocyte Progenitors by Microgravity: Implications for Multiple Sclerosis and Space Flight,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9224676/,"In previous studies, we examined the effects of space microgravity on human neural stem cells. To date, there are no studies on a different type of cell that is critical for myelination and electrical signals transmission, oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs). The purpose of the present study was to examine the behavior of space-flown OLPs (SPC-OLPs) as they were adapting to Earth’s gravity. We found that SPC-OLPs survived, and most of them proliferated normally. Nonetheless, some of them displayed incomplete cytokinesis. Both morphological and ontogenetic analyses showed that they remained healthy and expressed the immature OLP markers Sox2, PDGFR-α, and transferrin (Tf) after space flight, which confirmed that SPC-OLPs displayed a more immature phenotype than their ground control (GC) counterparts. In contrast, GC OLPs expressed markers that usually appear later (GPDH, O4, and ferritin), indicating a delay in SPC-OLPs’ development. These cells remained immature even after treatment with culture media designed to support oligodendrocyte (OL) maturation. The most remarkable and surprising finding was that the iron carrier glycoprotein Tf, previously described as an early marker for OLPs, was expressed ectopically in the nucleus of all SPC-OLPs. In contrast, their GC counterparts expressed it exclusively in the cytoplasm, as previously described. In addition, analysis of the secretome demonstrated that SPC-OLPs contained 3.5 times more Tf than that of GC cells, indicating that Tf is gravitationally regulated, opening two main fields of study to understand the upregulation of the Tf gene and secretion of the protein that keep OLPs at a progenitor stage rather than moving forward to more mature phenotypes. Alternatively, because Tf is an autocrine and paracrine factor in the central nervous system (CNS), in the absence of neurons, it accumulated in the secretome collected after space flight. We conclude that microgravity is becoming a novel platform to study why in some myelin disorders OLPs are present but do not mature.",previous studies examined effects space microgravity human neural stem cells date studies different type cell critical myelination electrical signals transmission oligodendrocyte progenitors olps purpose present study examine behavior spaceflown olps spcolps adapting earths gravity found spcolps survived proliferated normally nonetheless displayed incomplete cytokinesis morphological ontogenetic analyses showed remained healthy expressed immature olp markers sox pdgfr transferrin space flight confirmed spcolps displayed immature phenotype ground control counterparts contrast olps expressed markers usually appear later gpdh ferritin indicating delay spcolps development cells remained immature even treatment culture media designed support oligodendrocyte maturation remarkable surprising finding iron carrier glycoprotein previously described early marker olps expressed ectopically nucleus spcolps contrast counterparts expressed exclusively cytoplasm previously described addition analysis secretome demonstrated spcolps contained times cells indicating gravitationally regulated opening two main fields study understand upregulation gene secretion protein keep olps progenitor stage rather moving forward mature phenotypes alternatively autocrine paracrine factor central nervous system cns absence neurons accumulated secretome collected space flight conclude microgravity becoming novel platform study myelin disorders olps present mature

Changes in Mouse Thymus and Spleen after Return from the STS-135 Mission in Space,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3777930/,"Our previous results with flight (FLT) mice showed abnormalities in thymuses and spleens that have potential to compromise immune defense mechanisms. In this study, the organs were further evaluated in C57BL/6 mice after Space Shuttle Atlantis returned from a 13-day mission. Thymuses and spleens were harvested from FLT mice and ground controls housed in similar animal enclosure modules (AEM). Organ and body mass, DNA fragmentation and expression of genes related to T cells and cancer were determined. Although significance was not obtained for thymus mass, DNA fragmentation was greater in the FLT group (P<0.01). Spleen mass alone and relative to body mass was significantly decreased in FLT mice (P<0.05). In FLT thymuses, 6/84 T cell-related genes were affected versus the AEM control group (P<0.05; up: IL10, Il18bp, Il18r1, Spp1; down: Ccl7, IL6); 15/84 cancer-related genes had altered expression (P<0.05; up: Casp8, FGFR2, Figf, Hgf, IGF1, Itga4, Ncam1, Pdgfa, Pik3r1, Serpinb2, Sykb; down: Cdc25a, E2F1, Mmp9, Myc).

Pathway analysis (apoptosis signaling and checkpoint regulation) was used to map relationships among the cancer–related genes. The results showed that a relatively short mission in space had a significant impact on both organs. The findings also indicate that immune system aberrations due to stressors associated with space travel should be included when estimating risk for pathologies such as cancer and infection and in designing appropriate countermeasures.

However, our knowledge of male physiology far exceeds our knowledge of female's, which creates an important gap that needs to be addressed to understand the sex‐based differences regarding musculoskeletal adaptation to unloading and reloading, necessary to preserve health of both sexes. Using a ground‐based model of total unloading for 14 days and reloading at full weight‐bearing for 7 days rats, we aimed to compare the musculoskeletal adaptations between males and females. Our results reveal the existence of significant differences. Indeed, males experienced bone loss both during the unloading and the reloading period while females did not. During simulated microgravity, males and females showed comparable muscle deconditioning with a significant decline in rear paw grip strength. However, after 7 days of recovery, muscle strength improved. Additionally, sex‐based differences in myofiber size existing at baseline are significantly reduced or eliminated following unloading and recovery.",technological advances made expand space exploration astronauts spend extended amounts time space returning earth situation unloading reloading influences human physiology readaptation full weightbearing may significantly impact astronauts health earth similar situations observed patients bedridden suffer sportrelated injuries however knowledge male physiology far exceeds knowledge females creates important gap needs addressed understand sexbased differences regarding musculoskeletal adaptation unloading reloading necessary preserve health sexes using groundbased model total unloading days reloading full weightbearing days rats aimed compare musculoskeletal adaptations males females results reveal existence significant differences indeed males experienced bone loss unloading reloading period females simulated microgravity males females showed comparable muscle deconditioning significant decline rear paw grip strength however days recovery muscle strength improved additionally sexbased differences myofiber size existing baseline significantly reduced eliminated following unloading recovery
Whole metagenome profiles of particulates collected from the International Space Station,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5514531/,"The built environment of the International Space Station (ISS) is a highly specialized space in terms of both physical characteristics and habitation requirements. It is unique with respect to conditions of microgravity, exposure to space radiation, and increased carbon dioxide concentrations. Additionally, astronauts inhabit a large proportion of this environment. The microbial composition of ISS particulates has been reported; however, its functional genomics, which are pertinent due to potential impact of its constituents on human health and operational mission success, are not yet characterized. This study examined the whole metagenome of ISS microbes at both species- and gene-level resolution. Air filter and dust samples from the ISS were analyzed and compared to samples collected in a terrestrial cleanroom environment. Furthermore, metagenome mining was carried out to characterize dominant, virulent, and novel microorganisms. The whole genome sequences of select cultivable strains isolated from these samples were extracted from the metagenome and compared. Species-level composition in the ISS was found to be largely dominated by Corynebacterium ihumii GD7, with overall microbial diversity being lower in the ISS relative to the cleanroom samples. When examining detection of microbial genes relevant to human health such as antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, it was found that a larger number of relevant gene categories were observed in the ISS relative to the cleanroom. Strain-level cross-sample comparisons were made for Corynebacterium, Bacillus, and Aspergillus showing possible distinctions in the dominant strain between samples. Species-level analyses demonstrated distinct differences between the ISS and cleanroom samples, indicating that the cleanroom population is not necessarily reflective of space habitation environments. The overall population of viable microorganisms and the functional diversity inherent to this unique closed environment are of critical interest with respect to future space habitation. Observations and studies such as these will be important to evaluating the conditions required for long-term health of human occupants in such environments.",built environment international space station iss highly specialized space terms physical characteristics habitation requirements unique respect conditions microgravity exposure space radiation increased carbon dioxide concentrations additionally astronauts inhabit large proportion environment microbial composition iss particulates reported however functional genomics pertinent due potential impact constituents human health operational mission success yet characterized study examined whole metagenome iss microbes species genelevel resolution air filter dust samples iss analyzed compared samples collected terrestrial cleanroom environment furthermore metagenome mining carried characterize dominant virulent novel microorganisms whole genome sequences select cultivable strains isolated samples extracted metagenome compared specieslevel composition iss found largely dominated corynebacterium ihumii overall microbial diversity lower iss relative cleanroom samples examining detection microbial genes relevant human health antimicrobial resistance virulence genes found larger number relevant gene categories observed iss relative cleanroom strainlevel crosssample comparisons made corynebacterium bacillus aspergillus showing possible distinctions dominant strain samples specieslevel analyses demonstrated distinct differences iss cleanroom samples indicating cleanroom population necessarily reflective space habitation environments overall population viable microorganisms functional diversity inherent unique closed environment critical interest respect future space habitation observations studies important evaluating conditions required longterm health human occupants environments
Succession and persistence of microbial communities and antimicrobial resistance genes associated with International Space Station environmental surfaces,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6234677/,"The International Space Station (ISS) is an ideal test bed for studying the effects of microbial persistence and succession on a closed system during long space flight. Culture-based analyses, targeted gene-based amplicon sequencing (bacteriome, mycobiome, and resistome), and shotgun metagenomics approaches have previously been performed on ISS environmental sample sets using whole genome amplification (WGA). However, this is the first study reporting on the metagenomes sampled from ISS environmental surfaces without the use of WGA. Metagenome sequences generated from eight defined ISS environmental locations in three consecutive flights were analyzed to assess the succession and persistence of microbial communities, their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles, and virulence properties. Metagenomic sequences were produced from the samples treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to measure intact microorganisms. The intact microbial communities detected in Flight 1 and Flight 2 samples were significantly more similar to each other than to Flight 3 samples. Among 318 microbial species detected, 46 species constituting 18 genera were common in all flight samples. Risk group or biosafety level 2 microorganisms that persisted among all three flights were Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia frederiksenii, and Aspergillus lentulus. Even though Rhodotorula and Pantoea dominated the ISS microbiome, Pantoea exhibited succession and persistence. K. pneumoniae persisted in one location (US Node 1) of all three flights and might have spread to six out of the eight locations sampled on Flight 3. The AMR signatures associated with β-lactam, cationic antimicrobial peptide, and vancomycin were detected. Prominent virulence factors were cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance and multidrug-resistance efflux pumps. There was an increase in AMR and virulence gene factors detected over the period sampled, and metagenome sequences of human pathogens persisted over time. Comparative analysis of the microbial compositions of ISS with Earth analogs revealed that the ISS environmental surfaces were different in microbial composition. Metagenomics coupled with PMA treatment would help future space missions to estimate problematic risk group microbial pathogens. Cataloging AMR/virulence characteristics, succession, accumulation, and persistence of microorganisms would facilitate the development of suitable countermeasures to reduce their presence in the closed built environment.",international space station iss ideal test bed studying effects microbial persistence succession closed system long space flight culturebased analyses targeted genebased amplicon sequencing bacteriome mycobiome resistome shotgun metagenomics approaches previously performed iss environmental sample sets using whole genome amplification wga however first study reporting metagenomes sampled iss environmental surfaces without use wga metagenome sequences generated eight defined iss environmental locations three consecutive flights analyzed assess succession persistence microbial communities antimicrobial resistance amr profiles virulence properties metagenomic sequences produced samples treated propidium monoazide pma measure intact microorganisms intact microbial communities detected flight flight samples significantly similar flight samples among microbial species detected species constituting genera common flight samples risk group biosafety level microorganisms persisted among three flights acinetobacter baumannii haemophilus influenzae klebsiella pneumoniae salmonella enterica shigella sonnei staphylococcus aureus yersinia frederiksenii aspergillus lentulus even though rhodotorula pantoea dominated iss microbiome pantoea exhibited succession persistence pneumoniae persisted one location node three flights might spread six eight locations sampled flight amr signatures associated lactam cationic antimicrobial peptide vancomycin detected prominent virulence factors cobaltzinccadmium resistance multidrugresistance efflux pumps increase amr virulence gene factors detected period sampled metagenome sequences human pathogens persisted time comparative analysis microbial compositions iss earth analogs revealed iss environmental surfaces different microbial composition metagenomics coupled pma treatment would help future space missions estimate problematic risk group microbial pathogens cataloging amrvirulence characteristics succession accumulation persistence microorganisms would facilitate development suitable countermeasures reduce presence closed built environment
Editorial: Revisiting the limits of plant life - plant adaptations to extreme terrestrial environments relating to astrobiology and space biology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10472590/,"This editorial explores plant adaptations to extreme terrestrial environments, elucidating their critical relevance for astrobiology and deep space exploration. The objective is to leverage insights from extremophyte biology to advance the selection of robust plant characteristics for sustainable human space missions, including resource independence and extraterrestrial settlements, and to guide the search for life beyond Earth. Through a collation of articles, diverse studies were examined. For example, research addressed plant roles in mitigating cosmic ionizing radiation hazards and the importance of understanding extraterrestrial regolith properties for future space agriculture. One study demonstrated enhanced crop performance and nutritional quality under simulated deep space conditions when co-cultured with endophytic fungi from the Atacama Desert. Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of terrestrial extremophytes and their associated symbionts to inform bio-design principles for novel space ecosystems and contribute to developing genetically engineered space food plants, thereby expanding our understanding of life's adaptability.",editorial explores plant adaptations extreme terrestrial environments elucidating critical relevance astrobiology deep space exploration objective leverage insights extremophyte biology advance selection robust plant characteristics sustainable human space missions including resource independence extraterrestrial settlements guide search life beyond earth collation articles diverse studies examined example research addressed plant roles mitigating cosmic ionizing radiation hazards importance understanding extraterrestrial regolith properties future space agriculture one study demonstrated enhanced crop performance nutritional quality simulated deep space conditions cocultured endophytic fungi atacama desert collectively findings underscore potential terrestrial extremophytes associated symbionts inform biodesign principles novel space ecosystems contribute developing genetically engineered space food plants thereby expanding understanding lifes adaptability
