Multi-omics analysis of multiple missions to space reveal a theme of lipid dysregulation in mouse liver,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6915713/,"Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) & BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of strain or exposure duration. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across all conditions including Glucagon (GCG) and Insulin (INS). Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis showed that a number of lipid related proteins were changed in the livers during spaceflight. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of lipotoxic pathways are the result of space stressors alone and this activation occurs in various genetic backgrounds during spaceflight exposures of weeks to months. If similar responses occur in humans, a prolonged change of these pathways may result in the development of liver disease and should be investigated further."
ERULUS is a plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinase that specifies root hair growth by maintaining tip-focused cytoplasmic calcium oscillations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6048781/,"Root hairs are single-cell extensions crucial for nutrient and water uptake, with their tip-focused growth regulated by various molecular components, including receptor-like kinases. ERULUS (ERU), also known as CAP1, is a malectin-like receptor kinase previously hypothesized to regulate root hair growth by maintaining ammonium homeostasis, with a proposed tonoplast localization. Here, we reassess ERU's function and subcellular localization, challenging the prior model. We isolated a novel recessive *eru-3* mutant, which displayed characteristic short and irregularly shaped root hairs. Expression of a functional UBQ10:ERU-GFP fusion restored wild-type root hair lengths in *eru-3* mutants, confirming its activity. Critically, this functional ERU-GFP fusion localized to the plasma membrane and post-Golgi/endocytic vesicles at the root hair tip, directly refuting the reported tonoplast localization. Our findings establish ERULUS as a plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinase that specifies root hair growth by maintaining tip-focused cytoplasmic calcium oscillations, thereby providing a revised mechanistic understanding of its role."
Evidence for extensive horizontal gene transfer from the draft genome of a tardigrade,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4702960/,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), or the transfer of genes between species, has been recognized recently as more pervasive than previously suspected. Here, we report evidence for an unprecedented degree of HGT into an animal genome, based on a draft genome of a tardigrade, Hypsibius dujardini. Tardigrades are microscopic eight-legged animals that are famous for their ability to survive extreme conditions. Genome sequencing, direct confirmation of physical linkage, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that a large fraction of the H. dujardini genome is derived from diverse bacteria as well as plants, fungi, and Archaea. We estimate that approximately one-sixth of tardigrade genes entered by HGT, nearly double the fraction found in the most extreme cases of HGT into animals known to date. Foreign genes have supplemented, expanded, and even replaced some metazoan gene families within the tardigrade genome. Our results demonstrate that an unexpectedly large fraction of an animal genome can be derived from foreign sources. We speculate that animals that can survive extremes may be particularly prone to acquiring foreign genes."
Reply to Bemm et al. and Arakawa: Identifying foreign genes in independent Hypsibius dujardini genome assemblies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4896697/,"This report addresses previous criticisms and a recognized error in an initial *Hypsibius dujardini* genome assembly that indicated extensive horizontal gene transfer (HGT). To validate the robustness of their original finding, the authors leveraged independent *H. dujardini* genome assemblies generated by other groups using diverse filtering methods. Three distinct metrics were applied to these assemblies: the HGT index, identification of genes aligning exclusively to prokaryotic sequences, and classification of ""class C"" genes. Results consistently demonstrated a substantial proportion of foreign genes, with 3.8–7.1% identified by the HGT index, 164–384 genes aligning solely to prokaryotes, and 2.5–4.6% classified as ""class C."" Across all analyses, the prevalence of foreign genes in *H. dujardini* was significantly elevated compared to typical animal genomes. These findings strongly corroborate the original discovery of widespread HGT in tardigrades, even in meticulously filtered and independently assembled genomes."
The Evolution of Temperature and Desiccation-Related Protein Families in Tardigrada Reveals a Complex Acquisition of Extremotolerance,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11831363/,"Tardigrada is an ecdysozoan lineage famed for its resilience. Tardigrades can tolerate high doses of radiation, low-oxygen environments, desiccation, and both high and low temperatures under a dormant state called “anhydrobiosis”, which is a reversible halt of metabolism upon almost complete desiccation. A large amount of research has focused on the genetic pathways related to these capabilities, and a number of genes have been identified and linked to the extremotolerant response of tardigrades. However, the history of these genes is unclear, and the origins and history of extremotolerant genes within Tardigrada remain a mystery. Here, we generate the first phylogenies of six separate protein families linked with desiccation and radiation tolerance in Tardigrada: cytosolic abundant heat-soluble protein, mitochondrial abundant heat-soluble protein, secretory abundant heat-soluble protein, meiotic recombination 11 homolog, and the newly discovered Echiniscus testudo abundant heat-soluble proteins (alpha and beta). The high number of independent gene duplications found amongst the six gene families studied suggests that tardigrades have a complex history with numerous independent adaptations to cope with aridity within the limnoterrestrial environment. Our results suggest that tardigrades likely transitioned from a marine environment to a limnoterrestrial environment only twice, once in stem Eutardigrada and once in Heterotardigrada, which explains the unique adaptations to anhydrobiosis present in both classes."
Endoplasmic reticulum-shape and function in stress translation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4150462/,"This academic review article synthesizes current understanding of the endoplasmic reticulum's (ER) dynamic architecture, its intricate interactions with other organelles, and its pivotal role in cellular stress translation and adaptation. The ER, a versatile network of tubules and sheets, exhibits dynamics regulated by myosin motor proteins, which influence its structure and communication with organelles like the Golgi, peroxisomes, mitochondria, and vacuoles. A central function is the ER quality control (ERQC) system, ensuring proper folding of secreted proteins, with misfolded proteins targeted for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The article highlights the ER's critical function in maintaining cellular homeostasis during abiotic and biotic stresses, where an imbalance between protein demand and ER capacity triggers stress responses. These responses involve the ER sensing impaired function through misfolded protein accumulation, initiating signaling pathways and adaptive mechanisms, including programmed cell death, to overcome or mitigate stress."
"High atomic weight, high-energy radiation (HZE) induces transcriptional responses shared with conventional stresses in addition to a core ""DSB"" response specific to clastogenic treatments",https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4117989/,"Plants exhibit a robust transcriptional response to gamma radiation which includes the induction of transcripts required for homologous recombination and the suppression of transcripts that promote cell cycle progression. Various DNA damaging agents induce different spectra of DNA damage as well as “collateral” damage to other cellular components and therefore are not expected to provoke identical responses by the cell. Here we study the effects of two different types of ionizing radiation (IR) treatment, HZE (1 GeV Fe26+ high mass, high charge, and high energy relativistic particles) and gamma photons, on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Both types of IR induce small clusters of radicals that can result in the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs), but HZE also produces linear arrays of extremely clustered damage. We performed these experiments across a range of time points (1.5–24 h after irradiation) in both wild-type plants and in mutants defective in the DSB-sensing protein kinase ATM. The two types of IR exhibit a shared double strand break-repair-related damage response, although they differ slightly in the timing, degree, and ATM-dependence of the response. The ATM-dependent, DNA metabolism-related transcripts of the “DSB response” were also induced by other DNA damaging agents, but were not induced by conventional stresses. Both Gamma and HZE irradiation induced, at 24 h post-irradiation, ATM-dependent transcripts associated with a variety of conventional stresses; these were overrepresented for pathogen response, rather than DNA metabolism. In contrast, only HZE-irradiated plants, at 1.5 h after irradiation, exhibited an additional and very extensive transcriptional response, shared with plants experiencing “extended night.” This response was not apparent in gamma-irradiated plants."
Biological horizons: pioneering open science in the cosmos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11167097/,"This article highlights the pivotal role of open science in advancing space-related biological and biomedical research, advocating for the accessible and reusable nature of invaluable spaceflight data. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) is presented as a central platform housing diverse 'omics, phenotypic, physiological, and behavioral data from model organisms and human astronauts, enriched with comprehensive metadata. Through the collaborative efforts of over 500 citizen scientists and Analysis Working Groups (AWGs), OSDR standardizes data generation and formatting, ensuring its Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR). This approach facilitates advanced analytics, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), maximizing the utility of limited spaceflight resources. NASA’s ""Transform to Open Science"" (TOPS) program further accelerates the adoption of reproducible research and trains scientists in open science principles. The successful utilization of OSDR data, exemplified by the ""Second Space Age"" Nature portfolio Collection, underscores how open data sharing enables groundbreaking discoveries and meta-analyses. Ultimately, integrating open science, standardized data, and AI is deemed essential for pioneering future deep space biology and health support."
Delayed Maturation of Oligodendrocyte Progenitors by Microgravity: Implications for Multiple Sclerosis and Space Flight,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9224676/,"In previous studies, we examined the effects of space microgravity on human neural stem cells. To date, there are no studies on a different type of cell that is critical for myelination and electrical signals transmission, oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs). The purpose of the present study was to examine the behavior of space-flown OLPs (SPC-OLPs) as they were adapting to Earth’s gravity. We found that SPC-OLPs survived, and most of them proliferated normally. Nonetheless, some of them displayed incomplete cytokinesis. Both morphological and ontogenetic analyses showed that they remained healthy and expressed the immature OLP markers Sox2, PDGFR-α, and transferrin (Tf) after space flight, which confirmed that SPC-OLPs displayed a more immature phenotype than their ground control (GC) counterparts. In contrast, GC OLPs expressed markers that usually appear later (GPDH, O4, and ferritin), indicating a delay in SPC-OLPs’ development. These cells remained immature even after treatment with culture media designed to support oligodendrocyte (OL) maturation. The most remarkable and surprising finding was that the iron carrier glycoprotein Tf, previously described as an early marker for OLPs, was expressed ectopically in the nucleus of all SPC-OLPs. In contrast, their GC counterparts expressed it exclusively in the cytoplasm, as previously described. In addition, analysis of the secretome demonstrated that SPC-OLPs contained 3.5 times more Tf than that of GC cells, indicating that Tf is gravitationally regulated, opening two main fields of study to understand the upregulation of the Tf gene and secretion of the protein that keep OLPs at a progenitor stage rather than moving forward to more mature phenotypes. Alternatively, because Tf is an autocrine and paracrine factor in the central nervous system (CNS), in the absence of neurons, it accumulated in the secretome collected after space flight. We conclude that microgravity is becoming a novel platform to study why in some myelin disorders OLPs are present but do not mature."
Microbiome metadata standards: Report of the National Microbiome Data Collaborative's workshop and follow-on activities.,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8573954/,"Microbiome samples are inherently defined by the environment in which they are found. Therefore, data that provide context and enable interpretation of measurements produced from biological samples, often referred to as metadata, are critical. Important contributions have been made in the development of community-driven metadata standards; however, these standards have not been uniformly embraced by the microbiome research community. To understand how these standards are being adopted, or the barriers to adoption, across research domains, institutions, and funding agencies, the National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC) hosted a workshop in October 2019. This report provides a summary of discussions that took place throughout the workshop, as well as outcomes of the working groups initiated at the workshop."
The ongoing search for the molecular basis of plant osmosensing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411250/,"This article investigates the molecular basis of plant osmosensing, a critical process for land plant growth and development given their unique dependence on cellular water status. The fundamental objective is to elucidate how plants perceive and respond to osmotic challenges, which is crucial for mitigating drought impacts on global crop productivity. Plants meticulously regulate water homeostasis through complex mechanisms including efficient water uptake, regulated stomatal control, and maintaining turgor pressure, largely facilitated by the vacuole and elastic cell wall. While some osmosensing pathways exhibit evolutionary parallels with fungal, mammalian, and prokaryotic systems, plants also employ unique strategies. The discussion highlights that plant osmosensing likely encompasses both direct perception of trans-membrane osmotic imbalances and indirect mechanical stimuli, such as changes in membrane tension or cell wall integrity. Despite its profound importance, a comprehensive understanding of the precise molecular components and signaling cascades governing plant osmosensing remains elusive, necessitating further research."
To Infinity and Beyond! Human spaceflight and life science.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6188462/,"This article provides a historical overview of human spaceflight, tracing its evolution from science fiction visions to technological reality and its subsequent establishment as a critical domain for life science research. It outlines the progression from early conceptualizations and wartime technological advancements to the development of suborbital and orbital missions, which offer varying durations of microgravity exposure. Initial experimental flights, including animal missions, served to test the sustainability of life in space, though early challenges, such as Laika's fate, highlighted the imperative to understand physiological responses. These foundational efforts initiated the fields of gravitational and space biology. The article concludes that orbital spaceflights now serve as platforms for extensive scientific investigations into the effects of microgravity on biological systems, from molecular signal transduction and gene expression to organismal physiology and development, thereby supporting ongoing research into human adaptability and survival beyond Earth."
To boldly go where no microRNAs have gone before: Spaceflight impact on risk for small-for-gestational-age infants,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11455966/,"In the era of renewed space exploration, comprehending the effects of the space environment on human health, particularly for deep space missions, is crucial. While extensive research exists on the impacts of spaceflight, there is a gap regarding female reproductive risks. We hypothesize that space stressors could have enduring effects on female health, potentially increasing risks for future pregnancies upon return to Earth, particularly related to small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses. To address this, we identify a shared microRNA (miRNA) signature between SGA and the space environment, conserved across humans and mice. These miRNAs target genes and pathways relevant to diseases and development. Employing a machine learning approach, we identify potential FDA-approved drugs to mitigate these risks, including estrogen and progesterone receptor antagonists, vitamin D receptor antagonists, and DNA polymerase inhibitors. This study underscores potential pregnancy-related health risks for female astronauts and proposes pharmaceutical interventions to counteract the impact of space travel on female health."
Changes in Mouse Thymus and Spleen after Return from the STS-135 Mission in Space,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3777930/,"Our previous results with flight (FLT) mice showed abnormalities in thymuses and spleens that have potential to compromise immune defense mechanisms. In this study, the organs were further evaluated in C57BL/6 mice after Space Shuttle Atlantis returned from a 13-day mission. Thymuses and spleens were harvested from FLT mice and ground controls housed in similar animal enclosure modules (AEM). Organ and body mass, DNA fragmentation and expression of genes related to T cells and cancer were determined. Although significance was not obtained for thymus mass, DNA fragmentation was greater in the FLT group (P<0.01). Spleen mass alone and relative to body mass was significantly decreased in FLT mice (P<0.05). In FLT thymuses, 6/84 T cell-related genes were affected versus the AEM control group (P<0.05; up: IL10, Il18bp, Il18r1, Spp1; down: Ccl7, IL6); 15/84 cancer-related genes had altered expression (P<0.05; up: Casp8, FGFR2, Figf, Hgf, IGF1, Itga4, Ncam1, Pdgfa, Pik3r1, Serpinb2, Sykb; down: Cdc25a, E2F1, Mmp9, Myc). In the spleen, 8/84 cancer-related genes were affected in FLT mice compared to AEM controls (P<0.05; up: Cdkn2a; down: Birc5, Casp8, Ctnnb1, Map2k1, Mdm2, NFkB1, Pdgfa). Pathway analysis (apoptosis signaling and checkpoint regulation) was used to map relationships among the cancer–related genes. The results showed that a relatively short mission in space had a significant impact on both organs. The findings also indicate that immune system aberrations due to stressors associated with space travel should be included when estimating risk for pathologies such as cancer and infection and in designing appropriate countermeasures. Although this was the historic last flight of NASA’s Space Shuttle Program, exploration of space will undoubtedly continue."
Adaptation to full weight-bearing following disuse in rats: The impact of biological sex on musculoskeletal recovery,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10881285/,"With the technological advances made to expand space exploration, astronauts will spend extended amounts of time in space before returning to Earth. This situation of unloading and reloading influences human physiology, and readaptation to full weight‐bearing may significantly impact astronauts' health. On Earth, similar situations can be observed in patients who are bedridden or suffer from sport‐related injuries. However, our knowledge of male physiology far exceeds our knowledge of female's, which creates an important gap that needs to be addressed to understand the sex‐based differences regarding musculoskeletal adaptation to unloading and reloading, necessary to preserve health of both sexes. Using a ground‐based model of total unloading for 14 days and reloading at full weight‐bearing for 7 days rats, we aimed to compare the musculoskeletal adaptations between males and females. Our results reveal the existence of significant differences. Indeed, males experienced bone loss both during the unloading and the reloading period while females did not. During simulated microgravity, males and females showed comparable muscle deconditioning with a significant decline in rear paw grip strength. However, after 7 days of recovery, muscle strength improved. Additionally, sex‐based differences in myofiber size existing at baseline are significantly reduced or eliminated following unloading and recovery."
Whole metagenome profiles of particulates collected from the International Space Station,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5514531/,"The built environment of the International Space Station (ISS) is a highly specialized space in terms of both physical characteristics and habitation requirements. It is unique with respect to conditions of microgravity, exposure to space radiation, and increased carbon dioxide concentrations. Additionally, astronauts inhabit a large proportion of this environment. The microbial composition of ISS particulates has been reported; however, its functional genomics, which are pertinent due to potential impact of its constituents on human health and operational mission success, are not yet characterized. This study examined the whole metagenome of ISS microbes at both species- and gene-level resolution. Air filter and dust samples from the ISS were analyzed and compared to samples collected in a terrestrial cleanroom environment. Furthermore, metagenome mining was carried out to characterize dominant, virulent, and novel microorganisms. The whole genome sequences of select cultivable strains isolated from these samples were extracted from the metagenome and compared. Species-level composition in the ISS was found to be largely dominated by Corynebacterium ihumii GD7, with overall microbial diversity being lower in the ISS relative to the cleanroom samples. When examining detection of microbial genes relevant to human health such as antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, it was found that a larger number of relevant gene categories were observed in the ISS relative to the cleanroom. Strain-level cross-sample comparisons were made for Corynebacterium, Bacillus, and Aspergillus showing possible distinctions in the dominant strain between samples. Species-level analyses demonstrated distinct differences between the ISS and cleanroom samples, indicating that the cleanroom population is not necessarily reflective of space habitation environments. The overall population of viable microorganisms and the functional diversity inherent to this unique closed environment are of critical interest with respect to future space habitation. Observations and studies such as these will be important to evaluating the conditions required for long-term health of human occupants in such environments."
Succession and persistence of microbial communities and antimicrobial resistance genes associated with International Space Station environmental surfaces,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6234677/,"The International Space Station (ISS) is an ideal test bed for studying the effects of microbial persistence and succession on a closed system during long space flight. Culture-based analyses, targeted gene-based amplicon sequencing (bacteriome, mycobiome, and resistome), and shotgun metagenomics approaches have previously been performed on ISS environmental sample sets using whole genome amplification (WGA). However, this is the first study reporting on the metagenomes sampled from ISS environmental surfaces without the use of WGA. Metagenome sequences generated from eight defined ISS environmental locations in three consecutive flights were analyzed to assess the succession and persistence of microbial communities, their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles, and virulence properties. Metagenomic sequences were produced from the samples treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to measure intact microorganisms. The intact microbial communities detected in Flight 1 and Flight 2 samples were significantly more similar to each other than to Flight 3 samples. Among 318 microbial species detected, 46 species constituting 18 genera were common in all flight samples. Risk group or biosafety level 2 microorganisms that persisted among all three flights were Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia frederiksenii, and Aspergillus lentulus. Even though Rhodotorula and Pantoea dominated the ISS microbiome, Pantoea exhibited succession and persistence. K. pneumoniae persisted in one location (US Node 1) of all three flights and might have spread to six out of the eight locations sampled on Flight 3. The AMR signatures associated with β-lactam, cationic antimicrobial peptide, and vancomycin were detected. Prominent virulence factors were cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance and multidrug-resistance efflux pumps. There was an increase in AMR and virulence gene factors detected over the period sampled, and metagenome sequences of human pathogens persisted over time. Comparative analysis of the microbial compositions of ISS with Earth analogs revealed that the ISS environmental surfaces were different in microbial composition. Metagenomics coupled with PMA treatment would help future space missions to estimate problematic risk group microbial pathogens. Cataloging AMR/virulence characteristics, succession, accumulation, and persistence of microorganisms would facilitate the development of suitable countermeasures to reduce their presence in the closed built environment."
Editorial: Revisiting the limits of plant life - plant adaptations to extreme terrestrial environments relating to astrobiology and space biology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10472590/,"This editorial explores plant adaptations to extreme terrestrial environments, elucidating their critical relevance for astrobiology and deep space exploration. The objective is to leverage insights from extremophyte biology to advance the selection of robust plant characteristics for sustainable human space missions, including resource independence and extraterrestrial settlements, and to guide the search for life beyond Earth. Through a collation of articles, diverse studies were examined. For example, research addressed plant roles in mitigating cosmic ionizing radiation hazards and the importance of understanding extraterrestrial regolith properties for future space agriculture. One study demonstrated enhanced crop performance and nutritional quality under simulated deep space conditions when co-cultured with endophytic fungi from the Atacama Desert. Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of terrestrial extremophytes and their associated symbionts to inform bio-design principles for novel space ecosystems and contribute to developing genetically engineered space food plants, thereby expanding our understanding of life's adaptability."
To boldly go where no microRNAs have gone before: Spaceflight impact on risk for small-for-gestational-age infants,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11455966/,"In the era of renewed space exploration, comprehending the effects of the space environment on human health, particularly for deep space missions, is crucial. While extensive research exists on the impacts of spaceflight, there is a gap regarding female reproductive risks. We hypothesize that space stressors could have enduring effects on female health, potentially increasing risks for future pregnancies upon return to Earth, particularly related to small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses. To address this, we identify a shared microRNA (miRNA) signature between SGA and the space environment, conserved across humans and mice.

This study underscores potential pregnancy-related health risks for female astronauts and proposes pharmaceutical interventions to counteract the impact of space travel on female health. This study ventures into novel scientific frontiers by investigating the impact of spaceflight on reproductive health, specifically focusing on its potential to influence the risk of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. The research explores the role of microRNAs (miRNAs), critical regulators of gene expression, as potential mediators in this relationship. It is hypothesized that the unique environmental conditions of spaceflight may induce alterations in miRNA profiles, thereby affecting fetal development and potentially increasing the susceptibility to SGA. By examining the complex interplay between spaceflight-induced stressors, miRNA modulation, and adverse neonatal outcomes, this work aims to elucidate underlying biological mechanisms. The anticipated insights will be crucial for developing strategies to mitigate pregnancy complications and ensure healthier reproductive outcomes for future space missions."
